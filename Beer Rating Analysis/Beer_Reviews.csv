Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"2016 Silver Wax. Aroma has whiskey, maple, toffee and umami. Taste has wood barrel, umami, dark fruit, maple and toffee. Bitter cacao and coffee aftertaste.",4.8
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"The beer pours Pitch Black with a frothy tan head. The bottle gushed when I opened it. It smells and tastes of maple syrup, coffee, creams brûlée, vanilla, and warm bourbon. The feel is slick and smooth.",4.74
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Probably the smoothest beer I have ever had. Smelled better than it tasted. Lots of notes on the nose from vanilla to caramel/Maple to figs, but the taste didn't follow suit and it mostly being Maple supported by the others notes on the nose and barrel. No discernible alcohol present but the bourbon flavor was there from start to finish. Carbonation was lacking and would have helped the beer. Overall this was an excellent beer on par with Mexican Cake Reserva.",4.68
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Dark black, very thick, a little bit of tan head. Smells amazing - coffee and a little bit of maple jump out at you, along with chocolate and vanilla and other sweet smells. The taste is no letdown either, coffee is more up front, and maple is on the back end, with a lot of caramel / chocolate / dark fruit in the middle. Super thick mouthfeel with zero alcohol burn.",5
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Poured black as ink with thin ruby edges at 58 degrees; fast fizzy cinnamon brown head; no cap retention, ring or lace; medium legs on swirl. Strong maple nose with molasses and roast coffee grind right behind. Sweet maple syrup and molasses up front; bitter roast coffee; dark fruit - cherries and plums with chocolate middle; no booze; maple and coffee on backend. Thick almost chewy feel; heavy full body; rich velvety tongue coating; no barrel or astringency; warming from 12%; creamy feel/linger on tongue. Overall awesome; strong long lasting maple nose; main flavors are in harmony; subtle dark fruit and chocolate notes add layers complimenting the whole; no hint of whiskey or barrel notes; and the feel is superb; world class!",4.97
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"she’s got heat....but man is she somethin nice! lots of barrel presence. maple goodness on the nose. thick and chewy. flavor is all barrel, booze and molasses. What a treat.",4.75
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,Amazing brew. The maple aroma pours out of this bottle upon cracking. The pour was pitch black with a nice brownish red head. Carbonation holds and the beer is thicc AF,5
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Finally got to try the white whale. Pours like syrup, smells like syrup. Seems like it should be just a perfect beer, but I don't think TG does coffee as well as the other best breweries. I definitely got some green pepper.",4.3
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Had this on tap at the 12-15-18 release in Decorah. The aroma on this was amazing and was a step above the flavor. This beer is a very good mix of coffee, barrel and maple but just shy of a perfect rating. Maybe because the expectations are so crazy high?",4.85
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Had this on tap At the KBBS release 12/15/18 pour was super dark, no head even when i attempted to swirl it. great aroma, lots of coffee and barrel. Taste was silky velvety smooth. Overall an amazing beer.",4.89
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Great beer, but didn't seem to be worth the hype. For a $1000 secondary market, should have been perfect, and just failed to miss the mark for me. The nose was incredible, but the taste almost had a metallic tinge to it.",4.3
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Batch one, 2013, Enjoyed at GAB bottle share",4.91
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Pouring with a thick viscosity that's damn near reduced balsamic, a blackish-brown gloss begins coating my companion's lips at first sip, like she's gone full goth. A uniform, dark mocha blanket builds over top of the void black body, but that quickly fizzles out, leaving nothing but brown staining legs that coat the glass with a swirl.",4.87
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"This is the beer that I always thought Morning Delight should be - the maple syrup is prominent in the nose and taste, but not so forward and overwhelming that it becomes a bit cloying and unpleasant. The barrel is a bit subdued, but still comes through clearly.",5
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,A buddy of mine called me one night and said that I needed to come over and try this new beer he found. Man am I glad I did because it was and is the best stout I have ever had!,5
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"its always an occasion to drink what is deemed on this website to be the best beer in the world. regardless of what one may think about how such rankings are figured, it is a treat to say the least. i remember when i was heady and westy 12 before that, times have changed! after a couple of narrowly missed opportunities to drink this one over the years, my man drlovemd87 came through in the clutch with this rarest of the rare bottle. my pour is as thick as paste, slick and black like crude oil, and without hardly any head to it, near still in appearance, shiny, almost gelatinous looking. the aroma and flavor are intense but unfortunately (to me) familiar, i wanted this to be strikingly different, at least from a quality standpoint, and as good as it all is, its not head and shoulders above all else, it might not even be my favorite barrel aged coffee stout i have had this year (shhh). a few things are immediately obvious to me. the first is that whatever barrels these were, they seem to have housed some excellent whiskey. its not more or less of it, nothing about the oak profile specifically, but the bourbon character itself seems obviously better than most of what else is out there, this i will grant. the second thing, is that saying something like this is objectively better than something else in its category that is notable and near perfect and all of that, is highly problematic, approximations and cloudy memories and nothing more than opinion. factually, this isnt that much better than any number of great beers in its field, and i will stand by that. i cant spend the whole time drinking this thinking about the merits of a ratings system i dont control or other beers i like better though, that would be a foolishly wasted opportunity to enjoy quite literally the best. its full of rich bourbon, heavy vanilla and maple syrup qualities, even the texture of maple syrup, tons of barrel char and earthy burnt dark grain and chocolate, and a well integrated high end coffee profile as well, in some ways quite simple, but impossibly mature and nuanced, enhanced magically by the whiskey, and with lingering sweet, bitter, raisin, cocoa, and bourbon character. its as good as they say it is, that is not my comment. my comment is that others are at this level too. i am enormously thankful to have been able to drink this one, especially without having to pay the absurd secondary market prices this is fetching. if you are considering dropping some coin for this on a forum or whatever, i would reconsider, not that this isnt awesome, but its likely that your local bottle shop or brewery has something comparable...",4.55
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Love the huge maple up front with balanced whiskey, subtle coffee, dark cocoa; semisweet, wee cinnamon, big whiskey, the coffee is superb. Yet bitter, bold, and some plum, too for flavors; luscious, creamy mouthfeel that lasts and lasts; bitter, sweet, whiskey, roasty finish.",4.93
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Jet black with minimal head and a shiny oily luster. The nose and taste is big coffee upfront and settles into more of a Maple and Bourbon focus as it warms, however all three of the Coffee, Maple, and Bourbon remain throughout and interact well as it warms. The mouthfeel is an absolute 5 from the chilly beginning though the warm finish, with smooth sticky oil-like viscosity. Easily meets the hype, never had better!",4.99
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Batch 3 (2016), Bottle #882. 12 oz bottle split three ways into TG tulips. ",5
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,2016 batch poured into a TG tulip. ,4.9
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Incredible. Really exceptional. Most certainly the best smelling beer I've ever had. My buddy kept the bottle and it still smells like we just opened it, months later. Fills the room. Mouthfeel is thick and fudgy, espresso notes with that amazing maple and cocoa. Can't wait to drink my other one!",5
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Wow. More than lucky to be able to split a bottle of this with their own brewmaster! Lives up to the hype, the flavors keep changing in your mouth and you taste a whole buffet of breakfast, bourbon barrel adds some sweetness. Sticky and coats your mouth and throat and the taste lingers for a long time. TG creates some magnificent beers.",4.9
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,L: Dinosaur blood with a chocolate milk head. Ultra thick lacing with great legs like T-Swizzle. ,4.95
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"This beer turned out to be everything I wanted it to be. Great maple and coffee nose. Mouthfeel was viscous and coated the inside of my mouth, carrying those maple and coffee flavors with it. Delicious",4.71
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Huge maple aroma right out of the gate and a vicious, dark pour. Maple dominates the nose but chocolate, barrel, and some coffee see also present. The mouth feel is massive and coats the mouth for days with adequate carbonation. It all makes for an impressive experience, but the taste falls well short of world class. There is a sour note that I also found in Mornin Delight. Some reviews have described it as coffee bitterness, but that's not what I get. It tastes like an off flavor. Since I've tasted the same thing twice I'm quite sure this isn't just a bad bottle. I'm not a fan of MD and the barrel aged version doesn't cover over the flaws.",4.31
Marshmallow Handjee,Tastes like burnt Vanilla Coke aged in gasoline barrels. ,3.77
Marshmallow Handjee,Tastes like a barbeque pork chop dipped in vanilla icing. I do not understand this beer or the hype. I will not be hunting any more dark lord variant. Pass.,3.88
Marshmallow Handjee,"Jet black pour, dark tan head. The base Dark Lord aromas plus heavy vanilla and some oak. Wow. ",4.74
Marshmallow Handjee,"Split the 2018 version with 2 friends. I'll blame the perpetual hype but IMHO this was just a pretty good vanilla stout. Not 5 times better than FO, certainly not 2-3 times as good as Henna marshmallow. Yes the vanilla balance was perfect but honestly it started to wobble a bit as it warmed up. Not worth the price tag, hoping for a different variant this year.",4.42
Marshmallow Handjee,2017 vintage; drank 6/2/17 @ Harvest Hop Haus. ,4.92

Marshmallow Handjee,"Smells great, mouthfeel great. ",4.59
Marshmallow Handjee,"2018 bottle(silver wax). The hype is real! Been wanting this for as long as I can remember. Glad I finally got a chance to try a hefty pour at a nice share. It stole the show around a bunch of BIG beers. It’s crazy how much this tastes like toasted marshmallow fluff. Zero heat, and smooth as hell.",4.99
Marshmallow Handjee,"Everything I love about barrel aged stouts. Thick, oily, coats the glass. Smells sweet, but not overly so. The taste follows with sweetness, barrel oak/vanilla flavors. Not overly sweet, with enough heat to balance it perfectly. (2017 Handjee)",4.94
Marshmallow Handjee,My review is for the 2018. I had it as a sample several times at DLD. It is an great beer but not exceptional. To me it was a little sweet and lacked the complexity and robust flavor of Chemtrailmix. I think 18' FVM was better as well.,4.32
Marshmallow Handjee,"The beer pours a sludgy Pitch Black with a medium sized khaki head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of vanilla beans, marshmallows, bourbon, and molasses. It tastes of vanilla beans, marshmallows, caramel, light bourbon, and molasses. The feel is medium and not too sweet. A great barrel aged stout, in just thrown off because it’s not nearly as thick as the base beer.",4.79
Marshmallow Handjee,"My own personal white whale. Never thought I would have the ""ammo"" to land it, but finally everything fell into place and it was in my hands. I went old school, getting a bottle of Bourbon Barrel Aged Vanilla Bean Darklord from 2012. Bottle #755/934. Poured black with a smidge/ring of tan bubbles around the edges. Vanilla fills the nostrils. Now I've heard people talk that this beer tastes like marshmallow. I've also had other beers people describe as marshmallow, but to me the flavor was not there. Here is a beer that is truly a liquid marshmallow flavor experience. Not only is that the flavor, but it coats the mouth and ""stays for days"". Supposedly, this is also a 15% beverage, but there isn't a trace of alcohol in this beer. Was it worth it? As I am a lover of the sweet brews, it sure was.",5
Marshmallow Handjee,"This is hot, but full of marshmallow, vanilla, bourbon, and big dark malts; solid mouthfeel. But I want so much more from the body and flavors; such a hot, yet creamy finish. The nose is the best. Great to try.",4.54
Marshmallow Handjee,"2017 bottle, kept at ~45F since release.",5

Marshmallow Handjee,"2013 batch. I was a little concerned given the infection talk, but clearly no issues with this one. ",4.55
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Pours motor-oil black with minimal head. Nose is seriously off, like a cross between an ashtray and burnt sesame candy. Booze is there, too, but largely overpowered. Taste is extremely muddled. Peppery spice, smokiness, minimal barrel presence, with a lot less sweetness than expected from the rum/apple brandy combo. Flavors blend much more pleasantly in the taste than the smell, the mouthfeel is pleasantly thick, but overall this was a real letdown.",3.8
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"B2, shared amongst friends.",4.26
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,Appearance - The beer poured a silky black color with a dark mocha colored head. ,4.6
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"This is such a big beer and there is so much going on, it is great, but you can only consume about 4 oz before you're done or you get diabetes. Let's calm down on the ratings a little bit",4.01
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,2016 batch (#2) reviewed.,4.2
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Black color with dark mocha head. Aroma is really spice forward with lots of cinnamon, rum and booze. Taste is desserty with fudge, chili, cinnamon and some heat on the finish. Full bodied, smooth mouthfeel. Quite nice but not such a huge step ahead of the regular.",4.55
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Tasted from bottle. Pours black with beige head. Tasted against regular 16 Huna and 17 Bourbon BA Huna. Aroma of cinnamon, rum, almost a little nutty, some fruity notes and apple. Moderate to heavily sweet with mild bitterness. Lots of cinnamon, caramel, toffee, some chocolate and finishes with a moderate chili burn. You do get some rum barrel sweetness and just a hint of brandy. More intense and complex than the Huna and Bourbon Huna. Excellent!",4.68
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Pours a jet engine oil dark body with a mocha-hued head. The cacao and spice come aromas are strong, along with the booziness from the brandy and rum barrels. The taste is like no other stout I've had. Brandy and rum blend together nicely to add some complexity to the richness of the nibs. The chiles and cinnamon are very noticeable as well, but are balanced out by the chocolate and alcohol so it's never too overpowering. The chocolate and vanilla thicken this beer, and the heat of the chiles and brandy/rum leave a nice heat. Phenomenal beer that deserves the praise it's received.",4.99
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Pours one shade shy of black with not head, just a tight band around the shoulders. Nose reveals chocolate, peanut butter and a hit of cinnamon. Taste follows nose. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild, even carbonation, a hit of heat and a kiss of acidity. All and all a nice beer but I don't get too much of the barrel.",4.23
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Pours a thick, oily pitch black coloration with a small, creamy head. The beer downright sticks to the glass as you swirl it, leaving a short-lived film of dark beer and white lace. Smell is somewwhat subdued, pretty underwheming compared to the taste. Cinnamon is most noticeable, with a sort of odd earthy, musty, woody aroma being pretty dominant as well. Perhaps a hint of coconut there. Taste is quite complex, lots of chocolate and rum noticeable at first, with a decent bit of cinnamon and vanilla coming through as well. The chili really grows as you drink and the beer warms. Quite noticeable in the aftertaste in a really pleasant way. Quite a bit of warm boozyness there as well, but very smooth and mellow at the same time. Mouthfeel really is fantastic, very thick, sticky, almost oily and very smooth. I was considering waiting for CBS for my 100th review, but I think this one will do nicely. The barrel-aging really did wonders to the quite overrated Hunapuh here, adding a certain complexity from the brandy and rum notes along with making the chili stand out more and generally mellowing out the beer, creating a richer harmony. Still smells really weird though.",4.35
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,Very Dark brown with a tan head. It appeared to be less thick on the pour particularly compared to Man Bear Pig which we had drank before this beer.,4.64

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,This review is for batch 2. ,4.36
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,With so much talk about this being a disappointment This beer was fantastic. Has a slight chili smell. This is some chili up front followed by nice barrel flavor.some spice comes through and had a rich body. Overall really delicious.,4.44

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,2016 vintage,4.64
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,Not sure if I got it from someone who did not keep it well but I would say it's extremely overhyped. Way too smokey which overtook the cinnamon. Tasted like bad crab apples which came from the slight cinnamon and apple brandy.,3.96

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Rating batch 2, because I don't think this beer belongs on the charts where it is. Batch 1 is still phenomenal.",3.61
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,Wow the nose of this is just stupid. One of the few double barrel stouts I have had before in which the balance of both barrels work out in unison. Sweet rum plus the complex apple brandy notes bring on a truly unique aroma I have never inhaled before. The taste follows pretty close but not fully. Getting more brandy and rum and much of the apple is lost. Spices coming thru as it warms up. Complex flavors and very rich thick mouth feel. Amazing!,4.85
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Batch 1 is one of the top 5 beers , drinking amazing right now. Spice has dialed down allowing apple brandy to shine. b2 needs some time . Little to spicy right now.",5
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"This pours the classic Huna viscous black with a sliver of stark mahogany around the edges, and a super dark mocha, soft, uniform dense head that dies down sooner than regular Huna, but can also be rejuvenated indefinitely over the entire three hour session the two of us shared this bottle.",4.43
Barrel-Aged Abraxas,Had on draft from a snifter at Perennial.,4.74
Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"On tap at Hops & Pie(10/2017). Black appearance with a small tan colored head. Pleasant aroma of light chili peppers, chocolate malt, vanilla, cinnamon, light oak and a touch of whiskey barrel. Similar flavor, rich, malty and moderately sweet with a lightly spiced bitterness. Medium to full body with soft carbonation, a smooth feel and a balanced finish. An excellent sipper overall.",4.74
Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"The beer pours Pitch Black with a medium dark brown head that recedes quickly. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of cinnamon, nutmeg, Chillies, and earthy chocolate. It tastes of cinnamon, nutmeg, mild spice from the Chillies, earthy chocolate, and light barrel. The feel is medium and well balanced. A great barrel aged stout, but not really blowing me away.",4.52
Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Obsidian black, with burnt motor oil brown edges at a closer look, and very minimal visible carbonation, but for a thin dark mocha ring that dies to a silky surface fairly quickly.",4.22
Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Pours a pitch black coloration with a small, creamy head. Smell is dominated by rich chocolate fudge and an intense cinnamon note, as well as a strong earthy, oaky, peppery rye barrel note and hints of vanilla and chili. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by chocolate fudge, cinnamon and and a subtle but complex rye barrel character of earthy, musty, oaky, peppery notes, as well as lighter notes of roasted malt, vanilla, chili peppers and just a hint of dark fruits. Finishes with a light sweetness and some cinnamon and oaky, spicy notes lingering in the aftertaste. Full, creamy mouthfeel with a rich body and low carbonation.",4.34
Barrel-Aged Abraxas,Had side-by-side with KBBS and it won the night. Retains all the amazing notes of regular Abraxas with a perfect barrel character and mouth feel. Amazing beer!,4.9
Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Completely by accident, I ran across this beer at a craft beer bar that I frequent - had never heard of Abraxas. Barrel aged imperial stout sounded like the kind of beer I like, so I got a small taste just to see if I wanted a full pour. Didn't take long to decide...in fact, I had a second pour because I couldn't imagine any of the other 99 or so taps could have anything this delicious.",5
Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Lucky enough to get a tip of when this was tapping at this year's Great Taste of the Midwest. Otherwise I probably would have missed it. Because with so many beers to try, I find it hard to keep track of when specific beers are being tapped. But I am very grateful that I was near the Perennial tent around 2:00 when they started pouring what turned out to be one of the best beers I have ever had.",4.91
Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Green Session. Aroma has spicy notes like cinnamon and chili with whiskey and dark chocolate on top. Taste is spicy but well balanced with dark chocolate bitterness and light chili heat.",4.7
Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Quite possibly the top beer of the night, in a tasting that included the likes of BBT, BA Sump, and multiple pre-2013 Dark Lord Variants.",5
Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Once in a while, a bottle comes along that you'd be happy to drink, even if it were poured on to a gravel road. Barrel-aged Abraxas is that bottle for me.",5
Barrel-Aged Abraxas,This is for 2016 BAA,5
Barrel-Aged Abraxas,Damn that’s good! rich cinnamon goodness I feel the peppers in my belly. The Barrel definitely makes it feel thicker and mixes with the cinnamon well.,4.75

Barrel-Aged Abraxas,2017 vintage,4.7
Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Legit smells like cinnamon toast crunch w/ cacao, whiskey, light pepper; tons of cinnamon, barrel, big malts, nilla, lasting whiskey. What a luxurious mouthfeel; bitter, big whiskey finish w/ notes of cinnamon, cacao, and light spiciness; wowzers, love this beer, again.",4.97
Barrel-Aged Abraxas,It just doesn't get much better than this. All the robust flavors of the base Abraxas plus the additional barrel vanilla and wood notes. Exceptionally well balanced. Simply Amazing!,5
Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"2017 bottle. Chalice glass. Had at a share. 4 bottles-4 people with Barrel Aged Dark Lord '16, French Vanilla Militia '17, Marshmallow Handjee '17 and Barrel Aged Abraxas '17, in that order.",4.38
Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"I'm doing this off of memory as I've had the beer at the 2017 and 2018 Snallygasters, so I won't do a full review.",4.99
Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"This is worth the hype. The aroma is off the chart good. Cinnamon is delicious and this reminds me of a snickerdoodle cookie. Tons of chocolate as well with subdued pepper, creamy vanilla, and subtle barrel in a medium plus mouth feel. I'm not tasting anything really complex but this is excellent and the cinnamon and vanilla make it a real treat.",4.81
Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Had a pour at the Shelton Fest, and this is one of the best beers that I have tasted. Coffee/cinnamon and barrel notes up front with some spice on the end (absolutely perfect balance). This beer is surprisingly drinkable given the ABV and flavor profile. Absolutely worth the hype.",5

Barrel-Aged Abraxas,2017 bottle shared amongst friends.,5
Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"among the very best beers by ranking because now i am quite convinced that it is one of the very best beers! it is absolutely incredible, huge thanks to my homie in saint louis for sharing this one with me, its one of those beers that due to limited production and insane hype, i thought i might never get to try! so glad i did. i was keen on the base beer, but these barrels take it to the next level. fudge brownie or cake batter comes to mind right away, the cocoa and the vanilla together really make it rich and desserty, but synergies abound in this one. the vanilla notes in the whiskey and the actual vanilla, the subtle rye harshness and the spice of the ancho pepper. the smoked element in the pepper and the earthy bitter cacao nibs, the barrel char and the black malts, and the chocolate and the cinnamon together is also an extremely unique interaction! so much going on here, all fudgey and gooey and dense. the booze is little more than warming, the oak envelopes the whole thing, and i feel cozied, snuggled by this beast. cinnamon and soft smoke linger with a charred character in the end, subtle maple and molasses notes, dark ra chocolate, and smooth mellow wood. its all so good, takes an absurdly well done base beer to the next level. i am not often one to clamour for barrels or freak out about them, but this really is a transformation and a maturation unlike any other. an absolute delight, i hope to encounter this one again!!! hands down the king of the adjunct stouts...",4.71
Barrel-Aged Abraxas,look: Very similar to regular abraxas. super dark pour with a small but potent burnt brown head.,5
Heady Topper,"Pours a hazy, golden-straw color. Has a pillowy, off-white head.",4.66
Heady Topper,"Had this several times, straight from the can. So the look rating comes from one time 2 years ago I poured into a glass. What can be said about this beer that hasn’t been said. It is actually a very balanced beer, despite the overwhelming aroma that is first experienced. That balance goes almost unmatched by any other beer since this beer came to me. A truly unique beer!",4.87
Heady Topper,"Graciously provided by a friend, who was able to get this off eBay. We split a can in glasses. Of course it poured out quite hazy, milky, with a nice head and a peach colored glow. The nose was very nice, full of pineapple, mango and peach with some pine. The mouth feel was nice, smooth, full-bodied and soft with medium carbonation. The taste was a recap of the aroma with lots of tropical fruit and Pine. Bitterness was medium firm. The aftertaste had a bit of lingering malts which was nice. Not totally dry. No off flavors or aromas.",4.36
Heady Topper,"A - In can, so hard to see; looks clear and uneven bubbles form at top.",4.7
Heady Topper,"Highly over-rated beer. Not wurth the high price to buy it. Not much creativity with pine and grapefruit aroma and taste, Pine and Grapefruit is the most common flavor to bring out of hops. The beer did have a good mouth feel. I wouldnt suggest making any extra effort to get this beer",1.86
Heady Topper,"My first Heady was a Thanksgiving treat and it ruined the entire day, nothing at the dinner table lived up to the experience of enjoying an ice cold Topper! Since that time I’ve enjoyed a few cases and rate this beer as my number two all time NE IPA! You can’t go wrong and it’s definitely worth the sacrifice to run one down!",4.73
Heady Topper,"Purchased two four-packs of 16 oz cans at brewery in Stowe, VT. Served in 12 oz snifter. Reviewed 7/27/19.",4.02
Heady Topper,"Pours a semi-opaque, yellow orange with floaties and a rich, thick looking head that has excellent lacing retention. The smell is super juicy and fruity on the nose with a herbal complexity and a subtle, dank resin. Taste leads with pine, as well as grapefruit, melon, mango and citrus rind to make this juicy double, legendary!",4.58
Heady Topper,"Really the best damn IPA. Perfect piney hop bitterness melange, nice citrusy zesty flavors, pear, grape, apple, really soft and smooth, don’t know what more you need in a beer. Could drink endlessly. This two month old can is as good as when I first got them.",4.74
Heady Topper,"This is the original unicorn beer. As someone who lives within striking distance of Treehouse and only a couple hours from the VT border, surprisingly I have not tried Heady Topper until this last foray. I have to admit, eight years ago I'd have built a statue for the creator of this lovely stuff. Now it's a fantastic beer but others have caught up. I had a bit of a hard time distinguishing this from Lawson's Finest Sip of Sunshine however the beer was a tiny bit less pine flavored than Sip of Sunshine and gave a better buzz.",4.77
Heady Topper,"Sampled at home. Poured into a pint glass (I don't care if the can says drink from the can). The aroma and flavor of this beer are amazing. I've been searching for this for a long time (Thanks Bret!). For me, this beer absolutely lives up to the hype.",4.75
Heady Topper,"No canning date that I can find and I wonder if it’s not super fresh thereby negating some of the smell. My favorite IPAs usually have a stronger scent that draws me in. That being said, the taste is perfect. I love the slight bitterness. It has a soft feel although the newer NEIPAs are often softer. Perfectly balanced, I could drink this all day. Worth the hype always and the debate for me is whether Focal Banger is better or not.",4.62
Heady Topper,"The Alchemist recommends that you drink Heady Topper straight from the can, which I did with the first one. Glad I poured the second, as this beer looks nearly perfect when released into a glass - a bright pineapple juice color, cloudy, with a fat head. Lacing remained in the glass throughout. The smell is a strong grapefruit and hops scent, which is echoed in the taste. It offers a citrus and bready flavor while being very refreshing and easy to drink. Each sip finishes with a punch of bitterness. Yet the mouthfeel is clean, not dense, refreshing and a little creamy. It is a great beer that lives up to its lofty reputation.",4.75
Heady Topper,"I can be very critical— and there is nothing to criticize here. I guess that makes it perfect. With the hype, I was ready to be underwhelmed— but it lives up to 15000 opinions of greatness.",4.9
Heady Topper,The can says “Drink from the can!” But given the limited supply I had to try both from the can and a glass. Neither was disappointing. The flavor has an artfully smoky taste and a clean finish. This is a beer I have been looking forward to and I was afraid the expectations would be tough to live up to This was not the case Find it and enjoy it.,4.87
Heady Topper,The best part to me is the intense smell you get when you open a can. I could just sniff this stuff all day straight out the can. It’s suddenly become more readily available in my area of the world over the past week or two. Overall a good beer!,4.98
Heady Topper,"Although I generally prefer west coast IPAs, this was an amazing beer. I resisted the temptation to pour it into a glass and instead enjoyed it directly from the can. Too bad Stowe is on the other side of the continent or I would plan to have another Heady soon!",4.39
Heady Topper,The quintessential DIPA. Hits all the marks you can think of wanting when you want a non-hazy hop monster. A nearly perfect beer. ,4.78
Heady Topper,"I am disappointed with this beer. I just don’t find that it lives up to the hype. Give me a Second Fiddle anytime. If you area fan of very bitter DIPA’s, this beer is for you. I love IPA’s and DIPA’s but I don’t care for this. It finishes like it was brewed with hockey pads.",3.18
Heady Topper,No canning date (bought at brewery on 3/8/19; presumably canned within a week or two prior),4.44
Heady Topper,Very Hazy and cloudy look.,4.69
Heady Topper,"Look: Pours a dark amber-orange color that's hazy with a fine, white frothy head to headdy top it off. (Pun intended)",4.9
Heady Topper,Oh so excited as I open this can of Heady.,4.71
Heady Topper,"Golden with slight amber hue. Good foamy head and rich hop aroma. Mostly pine, with nutty, malty notes. Same flavor profile. Piney, lightly bitter and well balanced. Not especially complex.",4.25
Heady Topper,"Paid $10 for a can, and it doesn’t blow us away with flavor, so it’s hard not to have that sway the rating.",4.19
King Julius,Review #800,4.5
King Julius,"Slightly orange and cloudy with a creamy slightly amber head. Totally opaque. Juicy fruit salad aroma. Flavor is straight orange with faint tropical notes. No bitterness whatsoever. Very clean, smooth, and easygoing. Would never know this is 8.3. Really delicious beer, though I prefer a little more depth and boldness. It’s a top-end beer to enjoy with your wife!",4.28
King Julius,A: Turbid gold/yellow with thick head and thick foamy lacing. ,4.82
King Julius,"16oz can, Tree House snifter glass. Hazy golden orange body, bit of a coppery hue, one finger frothy white head, good retention. Rings of lacing. Smell is overripe oranges, citrus and grapefruit; mildly sweet grainy malt with a touch of white sugar. A bit of yeast esters giving off a bit of fruitiness. Definitely a Julius based beer both on the smell and palate. The palate brings a nice sweet orange and citrus presence, light herbal and resin, grapefruit as well. It's pretty similar to Julius with the malt and hops both amplified a bit. Not too sweet, but not too dry or resinous either. I think it compares similarly to Julius, and of course the mouthfeel is perfect- soft, creamy carbonation, medium body, easy to drink with a nice juicy finish. Overall- for what it takes to get, it's not really worth it over regular Julius- which when it's on, will be on par with all the best NE IPAs out there- but it is an interesting take and/or evolution of the beer.",4.44
King Julius,Appearance - pours thick turbid dark orange with a huge orange white head excellent retention. Tons of sticky lacing.,4.83
King Julius,"16oz can. Pours a turbid bright yellowish orange with an inch of head. Lots of lacing. Smells like a tropical fruit smoothie. Orange, mango, berries, pineapple and vanilla ice cream. Tastes like a creamsicle along with some mango, pineapple, peach and a bit of grapefruit. Peaches and cream finish with some bitter citrus peel. Soft with lots of carbonation and an oily mouthfeel. Pretty noticeable alcohol presence.",4.45
King Julius,Canned on 7/26. Poured to TH IPA Glass on 8/12.,4.78
King Julius,"Absolutely magical! Hazy, gold pour, luscious white foam head, both citrus and tropical fruit flavors dancing in your mouth, and one of the longest, deepest and ever-changing aftertaste that you'll ever find in a beer. It has a sterling reputation, and earns it with every sip.",5
King Julius,"King Julius, canned 07/26/19. ",4.94
King Julius,"After relishing the true king of beers (Heady) i was in the same position as many, somewhat depressed I had peaked too soon. The. I went to Tree house and waited on line for Julius and many of his friends. The second I poured the Julius into my mouth I realized there was hope, it was legit and I just knew King Julius was going to be epic. Unfortunately it wasn’t available when I was there and I had to wait what felt like forever. A week later my buddy was in line and they announced a limited number of king Julius cans would be available. Three hours later I’m opening a can of heaven and the True King was born! The absolute smoothest DIPA on the planet, it’s like mixing a wicked NE DIPA with a cream sickle with some magic dust sprinkled in. Never a bad moment as it settles on your pallate, unfreakingbelievable!",5
King Julius,"Can stamped ""Warden of the North""",4.9
King Julius,"The King in the North. Take Julius and crank it up a few notches on the flavor profile. Where Julius shines, KJ shines just a bit brighter. The smell is intoxicating and amazing. Immediately after opening the can the room is bursting with tropical hops. The term orange creamsicle and mango smoothie are apt descriptions by them.",4.84
King Julius,"Pours an opaque white-orange with two fingers of white foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is tangerine, papaya, mango, nectarine and orange, with a very dense, bountiful tropical fruit make-up. Flavor profile is tangerine, papaya, mango, nectarine, orange and mandarin orange with smooth and dynamic playfulness between tropical fruits. It's dense and flavorful, without ever coming across ultra-sugary or sweet. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a soft and pillowy texture that welcomes the tongue. Overall, hearty tropical fruits with a splendid sweetness meets pillowy soft textures for a delightful brew.",4.75
King Julius,Big thanks to Stofko1992 for sharing this one with me! The King pours out as a hazy orange color with a nice white head on top. Decent retention and scattered lacing. Notes of orange creamsicle and subtle pine on the nose. The taste has a piney resin punch up front that fades into a silky orange vanilla cream finish. The feel is smooth and kind of lingers for awhile which is nice. Overall it’s a solid beer and was great to finally try it.,4.43
King Julius,"It’s not the prettiest beer in the world.. looks like muddy pineapple juice. Hop sediment gets caught in the tight head. Smells like you plunged your head into freshly crushed hops. Crazy, pithy citrus aromas, pineapple and vanilla.",4.33
King Julius,"I am lucky enough to live within driving distance of Treehouse, so this is actually not a hard beer for me to enjoy. If you know that hoppy-grape bubblegum smell that hits you when you approach the Treehouse doors, that's what this smells like.",5
King Julius,"L - orange color, murky body",4.77
King Julius,Sampling a cellar temp 16 oz can poured into my snifter. The beer pours a cloudy orange color with a bright white bleached head of 1 cm that foams up even with a gentle pour. The foam fades away to a sturdy surface layer soon after the pour. There is some windowpane lacing on the sides of my glass after each sip. ,4.27
King Julius,Tasted from can. Pours murky orange with thick orange head. Huge citrus and orange aroma. Super well balanced crushable IPA. Citrus flavors dominate. Goes down way too easy.,4.89
King Julius,Not to say it's bad in any way but when a beer has the hype this has I just felt let down. Smooth and good body but kind of had an over ripe fruit dankness to it that just didnt land great for me. Checked off the bucket list.,3.9
King Julius,Fully opaque maize-tan with a large fluffy white head settling to a persistent film and chunky collar.,4
King Julius,"Fresh can, Orange straw, fully hazed. Big fluffy head.",4.6
King Julius,"Pours a deep gold with a close to full haze can see slightly through the edges of the beer. The aroma is a wonderful tropical citrus medley of candied orange peel, mango, peach and grapefruit. The flavor follows the nose with a burst of tropical citrus candy up front, thankfully not cloying, with a great piney, green resinous bitterness which makes for a great contrast to the candied tropical flavors. The mouthfeel is a light density and medium viscosity with a slightly astringent finish. Wonderful beer that I wish more people could experience without the hype, but thankfully it does a solid job of living up to it and I’m pumped I finally got to try it.",4.63
King Julius,"Tasty yet predictable NEIPA... they're starting to all taste the same. This one has good aroma and flavor, not elite. Drinks a little muddy and yeasty but still quite enjoyable",4.19
King Julius,Very cloudy straw-orange appearance with slight white head. Aroma is a prominent grapefruit that is slightly tangy. Taste is also a prominent grapefruit with a tangy touch.,4.75
Pliny The Younger,This small batch IPA I've only had a few times. Each time its a from a small pony keg that I heard through the grape vine while living in San Diego that a bar had it. It is excellent. I wish they would bottle it but I understand why they don't.,4.75
Pliny The Younger,"10 oz pour on tap at SD Taproom in Pacific Beach. Pours a near clear honey golden with 1 finger white head. Aroma is hop forward - pine resin, grapefruit, but with enough balancing malty sweetness and hints of mango, tropical fruit. ",4.55
Pliny The Younger,I am so used to the cloudy IPAs from the northeast that it was refreshing to see a great clear complex tasting IPA different from the pack. Not just different but worth the wait in line to taste something within a 2 week window of the year. The only attribute which did not exceed was the smell and although there was a tempered bouquet like a new wine it got better after a few sips.,4.82
Pliny The Younger,"Would have loved to have had this one eight years ago when there weren't so many great DIPA and TIPAs on the market as I'm sure it would've shined. As is, it's a good West Coast hoppy beer but not heads above many other similar offerings. It did hide the alcohol very well and drink much smoother than a 10% beer. Enjoyable and glad I was able to try it.",4
Pliny The Younger,"Mission accomplished! I was finally able to have Pliny the Younger. This is a piney, extreme tropical hoppiness bomb on the nose! Taste follows with a very smooth finish. This felt more like a DIPA than a TIPA. It has a subdued bitterness on the finish and hides the alcohol very well. For my palate, I think I actually prefer Pliny the Elder to this one, though. Still very, very good and worth the wait to try it!",4.72
Pliny The Younger,"Soft straw with a hint of haze, moderate carbonation and a thin skim of white head.",4.24
Pliny The Younger,Had on tap at Windsor after a 50 minute wait (2pm on Tuesday 12 days into the release.) Well worth the wait.,5
Pliny The Younger,"L: Liquid, buttery gold! It’s looks like you’re about to drink something very special.",5
Pliny The Younger,"On tap at the new Windsor location. A fairly hazy bright golden color with a frothy white head. There was a bright aroma smelled on the pour - piney with some citrus and stone fruit mixed in. The taste met my high expectations: bright pine, modest citrus, and floral, stone fruit blended in a wonderful drink. An assertive bitterness that was clean with a dry finish. Very drinkable and smooth with a well-hidden double-digits ABV. Exceptional and it lived up to the hype.",4.64
Pliny The Younger,"Definitely a solid IPA. Extremely well balanced. Hue is orange, and taste carries hints of citrus and pineapple. Very drinkable beer at 10.5 ABV. My tasting notes are based on a keg event in Philadelphia.",4.23
Pliny The Younger,The hand of god has came down to a certain individual and said make this and you will win. Nothing more to say than this is godsend. 4.75 on the nose cause nothing is perfect.,4.83
Pliny The Younger,"Tasted from draft. Checking off a whale. Pours a partially cloudy gold. Aroma is piney, medicinal, floral. Moderate to heavily bitter. Flavors of pine, resin, citrus, herbal and earthy. Complex and goes down super smooth. Awesome imperial ipa.",4.48
Pliny The Younger,"Amazing beer, elder is better. Smooth all the way. Notes of pine and flowers (sorry not sure what kind). Taste is great along the way, needs to be served cold because the hops tend to get a little dull with warmth",4.56
Pliny The Younger,"Tried it on tap at Haven Gastropub in Orange, CA. Crystal clear gold with a slight head. Good carbonation. Taste was very hop forward with notes of citrus and pine, followed with a light malty sweetness, and ending in a boozey bite. The alcohol content definitely shines through. Overall a very good triple IPA, but I feel that the alcohol holds it back. What makes Pliny the Elder so good is the balance of flavors, which is lost in the Younger. Worth a try for sure, but if you can get either the Elder or Blind Pig regularly, you are not missing much if you don't.",4.27
Pliny The Younger,Was at this years event (2018) .,4.74
Pliny The Younger,A fluffy persistent off-white head rests upon a shimmering light gold body.,4.05
Pliny The Younger,"On tap at City Tap House- Logan Square in Philadelphia, PA.",4.43
Pliny The Younger,A-Pours a nice clear golden color with a nice head and lacing,5
Pliny The Younger,On tap at SD Taproom during their 11th anniversary celebration on 02/24/18.,4.49
Pliny The Younger,"The color was a golden yellow, smell was citrusy with a bit of piney-ness and taste was smooth. It lacks the typical bitterness that comes as a smack to the face with triple IPAs. All-in-all, it was delicious. I liked smelling it as much as I liked tasting it.",4.38
Pliny The Younger,"Stood in line, being alone jumped me up a bit. Small, bright golden pour, small, scant head. Piney, hoppy aroma, flavor blossoms with resinous hoppy bitterness, ABV comes in late with a wallop. First sip was meh, but it gets better with each one. Scratch this off the bucket list.",4.33
Pliny The Younger,"A President’s day Miracle! On draft at LadyFace Alehouse, Agoura Hills, CA.",4.96
Pliny The Younger,"Finally tracked it down at Tonys Darts Away in Burbank, CA. It is definitely the best IPA I've ever had, and IPA is my favorite style, so I suppose it's the best beer I've ever had.",4.89
Pliny The Younger,"Finally found it. Orange gold with a fair bit of haze which surprised me. Elder certainly has no haze. Big aroma of fruit, fantastic. Fruit flavor doesn't come over in the taste as much as I was expecting more floral and Piney. Huge hoppy finish. Ridiculously smooth for a triple ipa. Most triple ipas i have had seem to throw hops in to throw hops in. This seems to have been carefully crafted for sure. All in all a huge fantastic beer and worth the hype in my opinion.",4.81
Pliny The Younger,"So smooth and so intense - lupulin galore. First sip was so intense and smooth at the same time, makes your throat tingle from the obvious density of flavor and amount of ingredients going into this brew.",4.7
Mornin' Delight,Poured into a 5 oz taster on tap at a special release. Pours thick and black with very little head or carbonation. Smell is nice coffee aroma with maple tones on back. Taste is bitter coffee supported by deep rich caramel and chocolate malt and sweet syrup notes. Body leans to the malt thick side but drinkable for a big beer.,4.5
Mornin' Delight,"Oh my goodness ! This may be my new top beer !! Coffee flavor with stout is mixing so well. Very nice mouth feel, dang, this is almost perfect !! Totally different style but it definitely going to rival Piraat for my number !. Only had a sample in the tap room, but I bought plenty of large cans to enjoy ! Not easy drink though, more on the serious side to drink slowly and enjoy. On high side of alcohol.",4.75
Mornin' Delight,"Pours pitch black. No head, but there's a ring of a residue from the head around the glass.",4.92
Mornin' Delight,"2019 bottle. Poured highly viscous motor oil with a beige head that disappeared quickly. The aromas is heavy in rich sweet maple. Just a little coffee in the background as well as vanilla. The taste is precisely the same. Mega doses of sweet maple. The coffee comes in but more like an afterthought, gives a mocha flavor with vanilla and some cocoa. I find this stout sweet, decadent as well as robust. It lends a nice full bodied mouthfeel with no alcohol warmth. Overall: it provides massive amounts of maple. Yes its no doubt a breakfast stout but I do kinda wish there was more coffee to help balanced out the sweetness. But nonetheless, this is a spectacular stout!",4.5
Mornin' Delight,"Pours a dark brown with tan head. Immediately, you can smell the maple and coffee, like a cafe with freshly ground beans. It smells really good. It's sweet with plenty of maple and coffee character. There is also a bit of bitterness on the finish. The pour I got was 5 oz. I think that's where this really suffers. It's a beer that you only want a little of. You can tell it's well-made as it's measured in its use of adjuncts. It's good.",4.25
Mornin' Delight,"Catching up on lots of historical check ins. This was a nice bottle with great flavor and mouthfeel but respectfully, having had it three times in a couple of months it's simply good beer - not worth the hype.",4.25
Mornin' Delight,Bottle poured into tulip.,4.38
Mornin' Delight,Batch 2. Bottled 8/26/15; drank 10/20/16 @ Harvest Hop Haus. ,4.49
Mornin' Delight,Batch 5 poured into a mornin' delight teku,4.53
Mornin' Delight,"Cracked it open.... eventually. This bottle had the worst, hardest, most annoying wax I've ever seen. I literally tore the bottle cap in two pulling it off of the bottle. Anyway, when I did tear the cap, the smell that burst out in my face was incredible. This might be the best smelling beer I've ever smelled. Basically smelled like I had a cup of good coffee and a stack of pancakes drenched in maple syrup right in front of me. Some vanilla and chocolate in the smell too. They should make a Mornin' Delight air freshener, I would buy it.",4.58
Mornin' Delight,Saved this for a very special occasion and unfortunately did not enjoy it. Thinner than described by others and too roasty. Definitely was getting a strong green-peppery thing going on.,3.06
Mornin' Delight,"On tap. Poured an opaque, jet-black color with a small, light brown head of foam. It smelled of rich, roasted coffee, chocolate, vanilla and toffee. Nice bitter coffee taste without being overpowering. Nice vanilla, chocolate and caramel.",4.6
Mornin' Delight,"At last, finally got to try one of the vaunted stouts from T.G. Now for what was honestly expected. Is it a great coffee stout? Yes. Is it a top 10 beer in the world? No chance. Now that we have gotten the hype proceedings out of the way, this is a decadent stout with layers of bakers chocolate, maple, molasses, praline, vanilla, pecan, smooth malt, and of course dark coffee. The smell features all of the taste flavors, but does so in the prism of the coffee, and adds some dark fruit too, amazing. Feel is worthy of the hype as well, with full and lush dark nature, but not overly sweet or heavy.",4.64
Mornin' Delight,Pours pitch black. Dark mocha head. Decadent. Great breakfast beer but having as a dessert instead. Coffee and maple blend so well together. Sweet but not overpowering. Thickkkk.,4.81
Mornin' Delight,2018 Bottle opened Jan 2019,4.73
Mornin' Delight,"Had this on tap during the 12-15-18 KBBS release. Excellent aroma and flavor. A maple beast! In my opinion this is every bit as good as KBBS. When factoring in the acquisition costs, Mornin' Delight is a no brainer.",4.83
Mornin' Delight,B5 poured into a snifter. Pretty good beer a bit overhyped. Smell was amazing right when the bottle got cracked would have pegged it a 4.75 but in the glass it's a 4.25 even after warming up the maple didn't pop like I would have hoped. Maple is there and pretty well rounded with the coffee I just was expecting more. Yes it's in the top 3 coffee stouts I've ever had actually this reminds me a lot of coffee shop vibes with maple. Wouldn't go too far out of my way to find this again considering this was supposedly a great batch.,4.2
Mornin' Delight,"Pours deep black and thick! Smells amazing and rich!! That first taste tickles every taste bud on your tongne and mouth! Wow! Amazing flavor; certainly a slow, sippy beer. Enjoyed two pours of this at the Field Museum in Chicago! Pricey but worth every $. It was everything I’d hoped for. Heavy maple syrup and chocolate tastes it’s the best I’ve ever had! Want KBBS do bad! But heard this is the Real Deal, same powerful flavor and punch, but not as sweet! My only comparison is SR-71, it’s easily as powerful and delightful, just with a much less sweet flavor to it. Had Sr-71 on tap at the Decorah taproom. Amazing! World class for sure! Love this!! Can’t wait to try it again. Must try both!",5
Mornin' Delight,"Absolute perfection. Was like drinking a warm, boozy bottle of maple syrup. Many beers claim to have maple syrup in it, but rarely deliver. This beer does. Though the maple is the star, closely behind is the quality of the base beer. What a treat. Every ""maple"" beer since trying this has been hard to live up to.",5
Mornin' Delight,"From 9/2/17. 2016 vintage, poured in a snifter. Awesome maple tone without being overly sweet, coffee had zero bitterness or harshness. Great balance of the two with a thick, motor oil viscosity. Better than most BA stouts I have had. Just excellent!",4.82
Mornin' Delight,"Fantastic dynamic taste between blended flavors of coffee and maple. Extremely balanced, thick, rich, and aromatic. Only complaint is that it is super sticky and I was basically licking my lips the whole time I was drinking it. MD b5 on draft at Field Museum, woooopp!!",4.8
Mornin' Delight,"Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Good head retention. Aroma is maple syrup, dark and milk chocolate, cocoa, and medium roast coffee. Roasted and toasted malts. Kiss of char. Flavor profile is maple syrup, milk and dark chocolate, medium roast coffee, and char. Roasted and toasted malts throughout. It's thick and filling, with a velvety texture. Overall, absolutely sublime coffee and maple syrup over a thick and soupy stout with power. ",4.75

Very Hazy,A: The beer is very hazy cloudy yellow in color. It poured with a short white head.,4.71
Very Hazy,Very cloudy dark straw appearance with nice white head that dissipates slowly. Aroma is a very pleasant grapefruit. Taste is also a very pleasant and smooth grapefruit.,4.75
Very Hazy,Haze has always been my favorite Treehouse beer. I finally got some Very Hazy and I can say without reservation it is the most delicious IPA I have ever had the pleasure of tasting!,5
Very Hazy,Canned on 9/11. Poured to Glass on 9/24. One can only per person on 9/20 ! But I was lucky.,4.76
Very Hazy,"My work schedule allowed that I was near Worcester and i finished many meeting at 10:30 and I could manage a visit to treeHouse. Pulled in to the lot at 11:15 and was out of there by plenty of variety including Very Hazy, a top 10 Beer Advocate beer. ",4.78
Very Hazy,Peaches and mangos for days. Aroma is dried mango and peach rings. Taste follows. Peach flavor is dominant throughout. Starts with That peach ring that transitions into honey mango. There is balancing green mango and grapefruit pith bitterness to counteract the sweet fruit flavors. it finishes dry with pith and on the long the peach remains. Overall a great showcase of what TH does,5
Very Hazy,"Canned 07/10/19, 11:16:30, ""PEACHES & CREAM"".",4.91
Very Hazy,"More straw haze than many of the TH pulpy orange juice look but pleasant enough pour with small head formed. In your face smells of big ripe fruit like pineapple and honeydew. Lot's of complex notes on the palate with pineapple returning coupled with grapefruit, straw, more melon and that ever present wet hops. The alcohol is a little more present than I expected or even wanted and that keeps my scoring on the lower side of the spectrum. I've been more impressed with other TH quaffs.",4.38
Very Hazy,16 oz can dated 7/10/19. Won in charity auction (you don't want to know). Consumed immediately. Three weeks old isn't too bad.,4.5

Very Hazy,"I am not as impressed as I thought I would be given the ratings. Honestly, if I had to choose this or Lawson's Finest Sip of Sunshine, I'd pick Lawson's.

Very Hazy,From can after having a Hazy can. ,4.92
Very Hazy,"In the glass, it's that beautiful Treehouse orange. Not too dark, and not too light, but definitely hazy and dense. Smell is sweet, creamy, and peachy, with ripe mango, and a little bit of citrus. Beautiful mouthfeel, dare I say, perfectly carbonated, with a lovely, smooth finish. They've got the fluffy juiciness really dialed in. Taste is fruit and magic but by no means too sweet. As with most Treehouse brews, the sweetness sneaks off-stage at some point during your sip, and everything ends on a very balanced note. An amazing beer.",4.4
Very Hazy,"The beer pours a hazy yellow with a medium white head that recedes quickly. It has medium low carbonation. The beer smells of peach, grape, blueberry, and candy. It tastes of peach, grape, blueberry, and candy. It has a medium body. An excellent IPA from Tree House, one of the best.",4.64

Real strong citrus noes on the aroma, that burst into my nostrils even upon the opening of the can. Very smooth and creamy on the palate, with very little bitterness to speak of. I've had quite a bit of Tree House, and this can really brought me back to my first experience with the brewery. Well done!",5

It has been a while...so was excited to see it again. Pours ultra-hazy, light orange-yellow in color with 1/4 inch head. Taste is orange, vanilla, peach, and nectarine. Light bodied, slightly bitter, with moderate carbonation. A juice bomb, but not one that overwhelms. The beauty of this beer is how subtle, smooth, and soft this huge beer is. Nothing bops you over the head with a dank hammer and that is ok. The body is amazing. A great ipa well worth the drive to get. I prefer this to Jjjuliusss by a lot.",5
King JJJuliusss,"Absolutely, positively the King! Totally worth the 4 total hours of drive time and 1.5 hour wait in line. If pressed to choose between the best Treehouse has to offer, I think I'd give Juice Machine the nod, but both are off the charts to me.",5
King JJJuliusss,"“You come at the king, you best not miss”",4.66
King JJJuliusss,*Choo choo* time for Tree House to run another hype train on me.,4.51
King JJJuliusss,Very cloudy deep rich darker stray appearance with a significant head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a nice prominent grapefruit and citrus. Taste is a little bitter less prominent grapefruit that is a little disappointing.,4.42
King JJJuliusss,"Brewed for 4th anniversary, reviewed 7/4/16.",4.98
King JJJuliusss,This thing punches you in the mouth with an overload of hops. I thought it couldn't get any hoppier than regular King Julius. I was wrong. These will be the best burps you will ever taste. Just a clinic in how to load a beer up on hops properly. Thanks for the growler Elliott!,4.83
King JJJuliusss,"This is an old rating from june, had an amazing mouthfeel with a juice explosion. Probably the best Dipa I've had from tree house, very green may be close",5
Fundamental Observation,500ml bottle poured into SP wine stem.,4.75
Fundamental Observation,"Pours black with a half pinky size dark brown head on draft. Aroma- very fishy tootsie roll,vanilla, chocolate, bourbon. The alcohol hits up front followed by the dessert vanilla and chocolate. Finished with strong bourbon too. Very well balanced. Pretty sweet. But not just vanilla sweetness. mouthfeel is thick and tingly and hot. Overall- fantastic. Very delicious beer. Could drink a lot of this. Well balanced while still being dessert.",4.77

Fundamental Observation,"Look: nice head, pours dark but somewhat thin",3.65
Fundamental Observation,"This beer is really good but a bit overrated. Joining a trading forum is a task. Not worth the price to acquire outside of Cali. 2018 Bourbon County Vanilla was better. I still have 1 bottle of 2018 FO. I will sit on it. Planning a blind BBA Vanilla tasting with Handjee, FO, Bourbon County Vanilla, Vlad Vanilla and others. Let's see whar the blind tasing reveals.",4.66
Fundamental Observation,"Split an FO batch 4 bottle with my cousin. WOW!!!!! This is what a vanilla stout should taste like!!

Fundamental Observation,"Pours black with a mocha head. Bourbon smell and aftertaste given where its brewed. An amazing beer, but not better than the finest from some others brewers out there like Other Half (5th Anniversary), J Wakefield BA Gourdita or Adjunctron, Prison City BA Wham-Whams. A truly amazing beer, and thrilled to try it, but to those whale chasers out there (like myself) - there are plenty of other comparables out there for far less effort and expense.",4.54
Fundamental Observation,Finally had an opportunity to have this due to a trade. Thanks @Rustytacos. 2018 bottle,4.68
SR-71,Wow! Got a bottle of the 2014 a while back and have been sitting on it for awhile. The whisky is there but well hidden. Very sweet. Velvety thick mouthfeel. Nearly perfect!,4.84
SR-71,Had this when on tap at TG brewery in summer of 2018.,4.78
SR-71,Enjoyed at GAB bottle share,4.33
SR-71,Incredible Russian Imperial Stout. Amazing barrel characteristics. Great body. Over all one of the best Barrel Aged Stouts I've had. I must say that I feel like Barrel Aged Dark Lord is just as good or better at a quarter of the price though...,4.77
SR-71,"I don't know what was up with this, but I didn't find this beer very good at all. It was slightly tart on the finish, which made me think it was going bad in some form. I didn't get much barrel character, thinner mouthfeel and compared to all the other stouts we were enjoying, probably the worst of the night which is crazy. Likely just a bad bottle, but didn't know those existed with this beer. Unfortunate, but rating is as accurate as I can be with it.",2.61
SR-71,"What an amazing nose that lingers well after I've stopped smelling; supremely luscious body, with the flavors lingering for a while too; the finish is boozy yet controlled, balanced, and well executed.",4.74
SR-71,Gold Wax bottle poured into a snifter.,4.54
SR-71,"This beer takes everything that is lovely about purple wax Assassin and amplifies it into a sludgy, brownie-batter-dipped-in-whiskey beer. Overall, the flavor profile is akin to Assassin, with bursts of fudge and dark chocolate on the palate, followed by waves of raisiny, dark fruit flavor. The barrel presence is more pronounced, with a woodier, more bourbon-forward profile, but it never delves into the trenches of the dreaded cicerone descriptor of, ""too hot."" The mouthfeel on this beer is virtually unrivaled by any other in the game. ",4.88
SR-71,"Pours thick and black, with a thin dark brown head that fades to a dark brown ring around the glass. The aroma is chocolate, vanilla and bourbon. The taste is chocolate, marshmallow, vanilla, lots of barrel, but not boozy. There also seems to be some smokiness on the finish. It's a little on the sweet side, but not overly sweet. The mouthfeel is thick. Overall, this beer is a work of art. Like KBBS, I was worried that it was over-hyped, but, also like KBBS, that is not the case. This beer is as close to perfect as a barrel-aged stout can be.",4.9

SR-71,"What is funny about my SR-71 experience is - while I missed the release of 2018, I was able to enjoy the OG bottle the very same day.",5
SR-71,Drank on 6/11/2018. 11oz pour. Silver wax bottle. This was set out for 25 minutes before drinking while the pour took roughly an hour to consume. ,4.89
SR-71,"2015: 4.9 Best stout I've ever had. Luscious, thick, crazy nose. Like smelling flavors of a good whisky....some heat, then fudge, then caramel, then vanilla. Amazing beer. Aftertaste is of honey and coats your tongue. Certainly sweet but great flavors where the barrel cuts the sweetness of the base stouts. Had side by side with Assassin 14 one time; Killed it. and way better then 2018 SR. I think this beer was a happy accident that they will never recreate. ",4.97
SR-71,"Had this almost a year ago. Was delicious. Great thickness, great mouth feel. Not hot. Great barrel taste. Smell was very nice, bourbon came through great. Great thick body",5
SR-71,"At the Toppling Goliath new brewery opening. Got a pretty large pour. Dark chocolate, fudge, and bourbon. Overall an amazing beer that I was very fortunate to be able to have.",5
SR-71,"Prior to tasting, I wanted to hate it. I wanted to love it. ",4.73
SR-71,"Side by side at a killer whalez share, this was incredible.... can't rank anything equal to Bake Kujira but this is definitely in the top beers I've ever had. Huuuuuuuge body - thicker than any body with no adjuncts that I've ever come across, barrel so well integrated into the chocolate-forward base. It's the best non-adjunct stout you will ever come across and was a completely different monster from that of a fresh 2016 Assassin, we had right before this one.",5
SR-71,"Had this at the Tasting to Sink all Sea Shepherds, at Moeder Lambic cellar, side by side with KBBS '14, MD #2 and yellow wax Assassin",4.49
SR-71,Very similar to Assassin but somehow better. So does this make this beer a 5+? Might need to adjust your rating scale BA to make Ron for a beer this good. Best nonmaple BA bet I have ever had.,5
SR-71,"Brownie, vanilla, marshmallow, roast, and barrel treatment in perfect balance. Viscous but not mucous. This has to be the perfect iteration of this style.",5
SR-71,"This hits all the right notes. Super thick stout. Sweet, but not crazy sweet. Toppling Goliath has done it again. This is nearly perfect in all aspects. I wish this was widely available.",4.63
SR-71,"I normally don't rate anything all 5s, but this is hands down the best BA Imperial Stout that I've ever had, adjuncts or no, and side by side with KBBS it blew it out of the water. This beer is phenomenal.",5
SR-71,"I gave it a 5, a 5, a F'n 5.",4.99
SR-71,"This beer is so thick, leaving layers of oily like substances on the glass. Great smell of bourbon and wood, tastes like vanilla, coffee, chocolate, bourbon, syrup, very smooth and very balanced. Great beer, happy to have tasted this.",4.76
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Happy to proclaim Founders CBS as my 5,000th different beer. Subliminal coffee, nice deep long-lasting chocolate flavor. This beer was aged over two years and so was extremely smooth.",4.63
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Wow, just wow! I searched for CBS for a long time before randomly coming across a whole case at a random party store outside of my city (Madison Heights, MI). I can’t tell you this, the hype is real. I like KBS by founders but man this is next level. It’s very similar to KBS but just taste better, it must be the Maple Barrels. It’s very smooth, not much alcohol taste, just a little bite at the finish but not much at all. If you can go this this beer, I’ve bought 5 more bottles just to age myself and enjoy when I’m not in Michigan!",5
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"355 mL bottle purchased at the LCBO earlier this year; listed at 11.6%, best before Sept 24 2019 and served barely chilled. Oh shoot, looks like I missed the BB date... by an hour. I think I'll risk it.",4.57
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),Hoo boy. Finally found a bottle of this stuff. Couldn't wait to try it. Lets get to it. ,4.59
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),This beer was $29 at Monterey Deli! The cashier gasped when they saw the price. I told them I'd tell them if it was worth it. Was it? I mean... it's a smooth drinking malty sweet coffee stout bomb... it's boozy and delicious... but probably not worth the price. But I did enjoy it,4.53
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"L. I poured this from the bottle into a pint glass in Brisbane, Australia and it was a touch lifeless. Not sure why. Great black/dark brown colour with khaki/tan head but the head was half centimetre at most and dissipated quickly. S. Nothing wrong here, although never strong for me. Sweet, a hint of coffee and chocolate. T. I agree with some that sweeter than KBS, which isn't a criticism. Rich, chocolate, coffee and sweetness. F. Syrupy, smooth mouth feel. O. Very good, although a touch sweet for a drinking beer. Might reserve for a dessert beer in the future and would be exceptional with macadamia caramel pie or similar.",4.46
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),Poured from a 2018 bottle into a snifter. ,4.66
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"LOOK: Super dark, black with no light at all coming through. Very Opaque. With a energetic pour, I ended up with a 1 finger head that was reduced to a foam ring in a minute or two. Some lacing continues on and it doesn't seem to ever go flat - totally. Foam was a nice dark khaki color. Expected as it is a barrel aged beer and a pretty high ABV.",4.77
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Pours completely black, big beige head slowly dissipates leaving sticky lace. Small bubbles.",4.39
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Look: No head at all, but big big bubbles sticking to the sides. Black upon black. Seriously, I tried to shine a light through this and got absolutely nothing. ",4.41
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"A dense, sparkiling, three-inch, copper-to-dark-walnut thumb lingers five to ten minutes. As the head settles, it forms a ring and a veil over the black beer. A coating of lace is washed away by long, slow legs on a Swiftwater Anniversary tulip glass.",4.61

CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),750ml bottle. 2017 vintage (Mountie is in the saddle).,4.43
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),WOW! What a great beer. Very pricey but worth it once in awhile. Maple taste is perfect. Smells of chocolate and smoked wood. It is a bit heavy and very potent but it looks great in the glass. Don't pass this beer up if you like stouts.,4.82
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"2017 bottle, cellar aged 2 1/2 years. Pours dark brown, near black, opaque, thick like motor oil with a dark mocha top. Lots of bourbon and oak in the nose, backed by chocolate. Flavors of massive chocolate syrup and burnt sugar, hints of raisin, bourbon barrel, and some slight remnants of coffee still linger in the long, sweet finish. Full bodied, smooth, creamy, slightly frothy.",4.1
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"WOW o WOW.. I really enjoyed this one!!! Pours dark, nearly black with a thin brown head that dissipates quickly. ",4.75
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"One the most anticipated and overrated beers of all time. Had it on tap at Chicago Street Grill in Joliet, IL. What a let down, no maple or bourbon flavor coming through. I can't believe this is rated higher that Funky Buddha Morning Wood which is way better.",3.63
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Yeah, this stuff's awesome. I've had it on tap and from bottle; I have two bombers in the basement. This is a legendary brew from the great brewing state of Michigan...from the great brewer Founders (aka probably by favorite brewery on the planet). You get maple, chocolate, coffee and everything else you want from a big league-heavy-hitter-stout! Is it better than KBS? Maybe. But maybe just because I finished my last 22 of KBS...",4.83
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Maple and chocolate goodness. It drinks so smoothly you better be careful! This beer might as well be chocolate milk as it's ABV is not apparent the many times I've had it. Occasionally I wished for something with more bitter backbone, but the maple here is on point!",4.66
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Founders Brewing 'CBS' @ 11.6% , served from a 355 ml bottle",4
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Yes, straight 5's is, well, rare. What can I say? Best stout I've ever tasted, and stouts are pretty much all I drink in the beer space. My first experience with CBS was on a trip to NYC and a visit to Three Monkeys, a bar in Midtown. The price tag was a bit high, but I chalked it up to location (learned later that location isn't a factor), but my wife ordered it. I ordered something else, which wasn't memorable. The CBS was amazing. I mean, wow. And the fact that it was an imperial and still so sessionable... made it a little dangerous. The nose, the mouth feel, and above all the flavors in the masterful brew is something I'd never experienced and since then I haven't found anything that approaches it. Founders makes a Kentucky Breakfast Stout (KBS) and another simply labeled as ""breakfast stout"". Both are actually very nice, but not in the same league as CBS in my opinion. The only downside is price. $25 for a 24 oz bottle is high. But Wow.",5
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"2018 edition, 355 ml bottle. Bottled on 24/09/2018. Poured into a tulip. ",4.46
CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Pours a pitch black color with a thick brown foamy head. Retention is very good and lacing is excellent. Aroma of maple, chocolate, mild coffee and bourbon. Nice and roasty. Taste had more chocolate. There is a lot of maple. Coffee bitterness at the end. Full bodied with mild to moderate carbonation.",4.51

Juice Machine,poured into a pint glass via can,4.69
Juice Machine,"Wow. Waited 2 hours for this and worth every minute. My wife was my mule, and also waited to allow me to get 2 additional cans. I was thinking of leaving her, but I’ve decided the marriage is strong again. As everyone says, a mash of 2 great beers and this does not disappoint - the best of their DIPAs, which is all I need to say.",4.78
Juice Machine,L: Orange and hazy with a very generous head.,4.29
Juice Machine,A: Murky gold/orange with rich white foamy head and awesome lacing. ,4.98
Juice Machine,"One of the most complex beers I've ever had. This is a hard review because each batch of juice machine I've had is vastly different. The batch from (I believe) May of 2019 was tasted superior to the July or April batches. Judging by JM at its best, it rivals KJJJ and VGGG. At its worst, it's about as good as doppelganger to me (still an amazing beer). The juicy papaya and tropical grapefruit always shine, making it an interesting brew at the very least.",4.78
Juice Machine,"Gentle pour into a pint glass. This beer is darker than quite few of the other beers in this style, similar in color to the meat of a slightly overripe peach. I get about 3/4 inch of eggshell colored head of foam. I'm expecting this beer to be thick and dank based upon appearance.",4.43
Juice Machine,"As a tree house regular I expected major things from this highly regarded rare brew. Unfortunately the aroma and fruity hop flavor notes were notably muted when compared to other Treehouse superstars. This beer did induce a starburst-like juiciness upon drinking, however I must admit I was disappointed and would strongly recommend other TH brews (my all time favorite is Doubleganger) over this one.",3.96
Juice Machine,I live within striking distance of Treehouse so I have pretty good luck in trying the best of the best from them. Usually with Juice Machine there's a limit of 2 cans per day per customer for good reason.,4.86
Juice Machine,"The best of Treehouse IMHO. Tastes like combination of King Julius and Very Green. Complex flavor with Magnum, Columbus, Amarillo, Citra, and Galaxy hops. Flavors of mango, orange, papaya, and passion fruit with soft mouthfeel and very limited bitterness.",4.75
Juice Machine,"Pours an opaque orange with a finger of white foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is papaya, tangerine, mango, orange and mandarin orange in a splendid blend of tropical fruits. Very light yeast soothes and swells in the back to help taper off the tropical fruits. Flavor profile is nectarine, tangerine, mango, orange and mandarin orange in a swirly, tropical fruit smoothie. Malts and yeast are absent from the forefront, with only soft strands of bready yeast adding a little smoothness at the backend. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a soft and plush texture. Overall, big tropical fruit notes in this smoothie of a beer.",4.66
Juice Machine,16 oz can fresh,4.61
Juice Machine,TREE HOUSE JUICE MACHINE IPA 7/3/19,4.59
Juice Machine,"Poured into a Teku glass. A hazy golden-yellow color with a medium white head. I could smell the aroma 3 feet from the beer when poured. Massive tropical aroma along with tangerine, pine resin, and white bread. The taste lived up to the hype. Tropical with complexity and a nice dank undercurrent. Silky with a pillowy feel on the palate. Exceptional.",4.63
Juice Machine,"Looks like a papaya milkshake, underneath a silky off white head, with citrus fruit aromas bursting from the can - the aforementioned papaya, tangerine, grapefruit, mango, some herbal notes. Wow.",4.56
Juice Machine,"Insanely good. Nice deep golden orange, nice head. Smells nice, minty, mango, citrus, orange, hard candy. Taste explosion, amazing sensation, mango, creamy mint, papaya, orange citrus, white grape, pear, incredibly smooth feel, no hint of the alcohol, wish they made enough of this to crush them endlessly. One of the best.",4.79
Juice Machine,"Pours a golden, ripe orange haze, with a nice, frothy head. Smells distinctly Treehouse, with notes of sweet citrus, mango, and tropical fruits. Tastes follows a bit more bitter, with flavors of grapefruit, papaya, toasty biscuits, and a little burnt caramel. Body is creamy and smooth, perhaps a little less carbonated than I generally like, but enjoyable as it is, and very easy to drink.",4.25
Juice Machine,"Canned 04/12/19, it pours cloudy gold/sand color with a 2 finger thick creamy head that was off white with lots of tiny bubbles in the head, dissipating very, very slowly and leaving outstanding thick foamy lacing clinging to the glass and leaving rings as it went down. Two weeks old and it still smells super dank with tons of topical notes, pineapple, mango, grapefruit, orange juice, papaya, lemon, lime, pear, orange peel, tangerine, piney hops, light peppery spices, light biscuit and more fruity notes like Orangina soda. Wow, what a start to this brew.",4.78
Juice Machine,L - brown orange color. Not attractive ,3.66
Juice Machine,"16oz can, just under 2 weeks old, Tree House snifter glass. Pours a bright hazy orange yellow body, one and half finger thick white head, frothy and substantial, tons of lacing all over. Appearance doesn't get much better. Smell is tropical fruit, papaya, big grapefruit, mild caramel sweetness, touch of sugary malt, but for the most part, the herbal and fruity hops shine here. Slight spicy resin as well. Flavour follows- it's a super hop-forward profile, with a fairly minimal caramel and grainy malt backbone, which is the way it should be. Big grapefruit and tropical fruit- papaya, light melon, touch of pine and spicy resin. It hits all the right notes, except for satisfying the massive hype behind this. Medium bodied, creamy and soft bodied yet substantial. A beer that is overall excellent but must be graded against its relative hype- and most people have access to local DIPAs that are half as good for 10% of what it costs to get this beer. It's a matter of relative worth and I think that while this beer is excellent, 100% of the people reading this review will be fine never having had this beer.",4.52

Pliny The Elder,bottle (into glass),4.3
Pliny The Elder,"One of the most pleasurable IPA that I have ever had. It is so well balances and has a great aroma and flavor. If you have never tried this....do yourself a favor, do!",4.89
Pliny The Elder,"In Sonoma, CA, in a pint glass. Blah blah, all the stuff that's been said before. I looked this beer up on Beer Advocate before purchasing at a restaurant and was staggered by the reviews. I was pretty excited to try it, but expected to be disappointed. ",4.9
Pliny The Elder,"Pours golden with chill haze. Floral nose. There's strawberry and grapefruit. It has remarkably clean flavors and none of the oniony character. The bitterness is clean. This is still a terrific and well-made IPA. Flavor wise, it is clean and well-engineered, but doesn't stand up as strong versus other legacy IPAs like Heady.",4.25
Pliny The Elder,"Having first had this years ago, it's nice to come back to and be reminded why it's still the ""gold standard"" IPA for me. Beautiful golden color, decent head and lacing. The smell is, I can't find the right words: pure? Golden? Wonderful?",4.93
Pliny The Elder,"Here in the UK, Pliny is a true rarity. Finally managed to get my hands on one bottle, thanks to a friend making the pilgrimage to RR. Shared it with my Dad in our micro brewery, while brewing our cloned version.",4.74
Pliny The Elder,"A good beer, with a lot of subtlety and smoothness (I've enjoyed it a number of times). That said, it's one of the more overrated beers I've had for the cost, and it's an example of how critical popularity can affect people's opinions of quality. For a much lower price, Racer 5 or Sculpin are just about as good and more widely available in California.",4.43
Pliny The Elder,"I was only ever able to snag one bottle of this from a friend that brought one back from Cali. I will have to say, this one has reset the bar for IPA's for me. For years I thought Bell's Two Hearted was the defacto standard for IPA's. Not any more! This stuff is amazing. Just the right maltiness to balance out the relative high ABV. And the hops....OMG, where do I start? I have brewed clones of this in the past that were pretty good. If the scale went this high, I would rate it a 10!",4.81
Pliny The Elder,"Being from Chicago, this beer was just a rumor. The times I have been to California, the story was always that RR shrank its distro area, didn't go here, didn't go there . . . so naturally I find two bottles for sale in the Colorado mountains having randomly stopped in a gas station/liq store for a Coke. I actually gasped when I saw it, like finding a soundboard Nirvana bootleg from the concert you attended. ",4.15
Pliny The Elder,"I was on a road trip last month and happened to befriend some cool peeps in San Fransisco. They told me about this brewery and how they make the 'best IPA in North America.' Intrigued by their comments, I made a pit stop in Santa Rosa and went to a few breweries in the area before trying Russian River. I'm not a fan of restaurant/breweries, but I must admit, it was a fun atmosphere. When I ordered this beer I thought to myself, ""this is the best IPA NA has to offer? LOL!"" Then I brought that golden glass of goodness to my nasal passages and was pleased with the scent. The only thing left to do was let my palate have a little action, perhaps too much by the end of my evening. I was pleasantly surprised by how smooth this IPA was. I do wish there was more of a carbonation texture, but this is nitpicking. Incredibly balanced IPA and I have been searching for it ever since finishing my road trip. I also heard they make a small batch called Pliny the Younger and apparently puts this to shame...",4.86
Pliny The Elder,"This is still the pinnacle of IPA's. I still would stand in line to get it, and it still still what I rate everything else by it. Nothing to me has unseated it yet.",4.85
Pliny The Elder,Bottled 3/25/14; drank 5/4/14 @ the Yarchives. ,4
Pliny The Elder,"Finally nabbed this unicorn at Monk's in Philly, on draft. Everything i expected to be. Texture of this beer is amazing, its head retention and lacing on point, taste was bold with hop flavor, but smooth like a double should be.",4.69
Pliny The Elder,Pours a clear crisp golden hue. Thin sudsy white head dissipates pretty quickly. Some light lacing is left behind.,4.5
Pliny The Elder,"Imagine my surprise to see this on draft when walking into a bar in Philly. Apparently, the only bar to serve this on draft (in a very limited supply) is the one I was in. I had three glasses. This was one of the original craft beer unicorns ... and for good reason. It's great!",4.6
Pliny The Elder,"A massive thanks and appreciation to Tim for giving me the chance to finally try this beer. This was a big-time want for me. Still, like all of my reviews, I strive to remain as objective as possible, resisting hype or other influences, and everything I write is done in real-time stream of consciousness format.",4.61
Pliny The Elder,"My white-whale, finally obtained. Overall, Pliny's a solid DIPA,but truth be told, there are equally as good out there without having to drive an hour to Palm Springs to get...IMHO, but glad I did!!",4

Pliny The Elder,"Being from Boston, all I could ever do was read about this beer. We were driving through Santa Rosa so I stopped at Russian River and bought a couple of pints.",4.37
Pliny The Elder,"Bottle a friend shared on Jun 13, 2019. Believe it’s about 3-4 months old. Poured into a pint glass. ",4.49
Pliny The Elder,Bright gold with a moderate head that sticks around for a few minutes before giving way to thin film that laces as consumed. ,4.71
Pliny The Elder,"Pliny is the perfect pour - a classic golden, slightly haze body with a frothy white head that leaves copious lacing. The smell is citrus with a musty back. It tastes of hops and more hops with a citrus zest, leaving a clean refreshing mouth feel. Pliny is near the top of Big Beer Mountain. Grab it when you can.",4.68
Pliny The Elder,"Presentation: Draft, served in a Revival pint glass.",4.55
Pliny The Elder,"ideal DIPA. It never disappoints. sometimes I wish it was lower ABV so I could drink this beer all day without passing out. waiting for Midwest distribution with all the new tanks, should be coming soon.",4.73
Fou' Foune,Drank at the brewery.,4.47
Fou' Foune,"Look - Pours a very hazy orange/peach color, with a very nice head and great lacing.",4.18
Fou' Foune,750ml bottle decanted into small snifters.,4.61
Fou' Foune,"Enjoyed from bottle at Brasserie Cantillon. Modestly hazy and apricot-colored, with as much head on it as you care to produce when pouring. Bursting with fruit, moderate tartness and a touch of sour funk. Easy to see why this can be rated as the best Belgian fruit lambic around.",4.58
Fou' Foune,Poured into Teku. 2017 vintage.,4.66
Fou' Foune,"Right up front I will say that I am not a huge fan of sour beers. I find them a bit bracing and not the kind of beer I enjoy drinking. Having said that, I do find them an interesting category and this one, while a bit puckering, was not as sour as some of the sour beers I've tried.",4.16
Fou' Foune,2018 bottle sampled from a plastic cup at midnight in the parking lot of Forager Brewing awaiting Nillerzzzzz/Crema release the next morning. I can understand why someone might like this style of beer but the sour notes of the Belgian Fruit Lambics just are not my thing.,3.6
Fou' Foune,"Clear and gold. Small but satisfactory white head. Smells of all the apricots: fresh, dried, jam, pickled. Gorgeous. Got that medicinal barnyard funk but not too much. Exceptional apricot flavour, but with a certain dank turn towards sea buckthorn and pickle brine. Bone dry and perfectly sour: tart, not heartburny. A fantastic lambic and I can’t wait to drink it again.",4.72
Fou' Foune,Bottled 8/26/15; drank 8/13/16 @ Golgi Apparatus. ,4.44
Fou' Foune,This is a world-class beer all the way around. The apricots and earthiness mingle well together and the slight hint of tartness are amazing...This is a 2011 edition and it is drinking incredibly right now. I have to admit that I never thought I would ever lay eyes on this but I'm glad I finally got a chance to try this. It is simply amazing. I love the way that the sweetness of the fruits and the tartness of the beer play against one another here. I am very fortunate to be able to have had a chance to give this one a go. If you ever run across this I would highly highly highly recommend it. It is simply incredible...,4.66
Fou' Foune,2015 vintage. ,4.22
Fou' Foune,"People differ in opinion, but I loved the fruity, tart, bitter and slightly funky flavor.",4.66
Fou' Foune,750 ml bottle drank at the Brewery in Brussels. poured into Cantillon 25cl stemmed glass,4.45
Fou' Foune,"Tap @ Moor, Bristol, Zwanze Day 2018 - Pours hazy orange with a small white foamy head. Aroma - Sour, unripe fruits - apricot, peach notes, woody feel. Taste - Tart, fruits - apricot, grassy notes, dry sour finish. Drinks really well with a nice sour fruit balance.",4.5
Fou' Foune,"Tasted from bottle. Pours a hazy orange with nice head. Fruity aroma with citrus notes. Flavors of apricot, orange and some sour funk. Crisp and easily crushable. Not overly sour. Incredible.",4.86
Fou' Foune,"04/2014 - The nose is notably tart, a touch yeasty, yet notable peach and apricots; funky, lactic, pucker all over the palate, with juicy fruit lasting and lasting; there's a unique bitterness in back, but the aforementioned characteristics, namely the the peach and lactic linger.",4.61
Fou' Foune,"Had on tap. Finally got to try this lambic, was skeptical of the praise, but wow this was amazing! The apricot just explodes onto the palate on the finish with supporting flowers, hay, candi sugar, peach jam, pear, and funky yeast. So much fullness of flavor while maintaining a light, delicate and exception mouthfeel. Smell is not as vibrant, yet does put the spotlight on the apricot and peach yogurt (yeast) aromas. Pours bright gold with plenty of white foam, amazing lambic! Despite my doubts, the hype is real!",4.69
Fou' Foune,"Pours and orangish-straw with a light haze and fog. Head foams up to two fingers in height straight from the bottle and retains fairly well. Aroma is peach with a light acidic straw backbone. Flavor profile is a jam-like peach notes, spread over notes of wheat and bread. Splendid smoothness. Mouth feel is smooth with a medium thickness. Overall, simply amazing. It's a kin to spreading a peach jam on bread.",4.65
Fou' Foune,Extremely well balanced lambic.,4.75
Fou' Foune,"This beer is as close to perfect as anything I've ever had. I will never stop thinking about it. I have nothing to add to any review, other than my input that this is tremendous.",4.9
Fou' Foune,"2017 vintage (1 year old) purchased at Monk's Cafe in Philly. Poured at room temperature, essentially.",4.63
Fou' Foune,"First fresh foune (2017). Beautiful fruit lambic with standard cantillon mineral undertones, soft acidity and tartness, thick ripe appricot. Definitely get the “yoghurtiness” others have described. Would still be interested to stick a few years on it to see how the fruit charecter develops",4.54
Fou' Foune,"For a special occasion, this is Cantillon's greatest offering. Justifies making the pilgrimage if a sour fan and even those who are more wine enthusiast will love Fou' Foune. Is a gold yellow with slight haze. Tastes of peaches, nuanced funk, balanced sourness, and a champagne effervescence. Enjoyed at the brewery in Brussels with family and new friends and really would not have it any other way.",5
Fou' Foune,"**REVIEW NUMBER 1,300**",4.38
Fou' Foune,"Pours a hazy, straw coloration with a tiny, fizzy head. Smell is dominated by sour funk, with some apricot and just a hint of citrus zest coming through as well. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by barnyard funk and hints of apricot and citrus. There's a light estery yeast note and a certain earthy and slightly spicy note to this as well. Finishes very dry and acidic, with only a little sweetness coming through, and another mouth-puckering dose of tartness. Medium body and carbonation. I really didn't feel that this has a very rich, fruity apricot note to it at all, maybe it's the vintage (2017, I believe). The apricot is there, but quite subdued and overshadowed by the strong, funky sourness and citric acidity. This is a very nice lambic without a doubt, but highly overrated in my opinion, as it is neither especially subtle nor complex.",4.1
Assassin,Surprise on tap at brewery July 26,5
Assassin,"Purple wax, 2016, shared with friends.",4.64
Assassin,2014 vintage...may 26th 2019....this is amazing! Every sip is a different experience. flavors all over the place. maple? vanilla? chocolate? Not nearly the viscosity of Sr-71 but LEAGUES ahead of all around! Worth trying.,4.81
Assassin,'13 vintage (yellow wax),4.84
Assassin,2014 Gold Wax,4.62
Assassin,"Dark black pour, lacing for days. ",3.91
Assassin,"03/2015 - This is absolutely incredible - the nose is big bourbon, dark chocolate, roast, and some vanilla, too; the mouthfeel is velvety, luscious, and full on whiskey, yet there isn't any ethanol; the finish slightly sweet, yet the roast and barrel linger in a wonderful union that lasts and lasts.",4.88
Assassin,2018 release (orange wax).,4.31
Assassin,Really good beer - solid and enjoyable but I'm glad I had a buddy who got a bottle on the cheap n shared. If I did what it normally takes to score this I would have been very disappointed. Smells boozy and tastes the same. Decent flavor but not great. The booze just over took everything else. I'm glad I got to try it but won't go crazy getting more.,4.44
Assassin,"Wow, very disappointed in this one. I would never do secondary value on this, and probably not even MSRP. It was like soy sauce honestly, glad to have tried it, but much better BA Stouts out there for a much better price, straight up hype train in my opinion.",1.86
Assassin,Orange wax ,4.38
Assassin,Huge thanks to David for this gem,4.59
Assassin,"Whiskey Barrel, dark chocolate and cherry on the nose. Very thick mouthfeel with raisins coming through on the sip. Finishes with burnt sugar and chewy chocolate. Impressive non adjunct stout here!",4.64
Assassin,"The 2018 version (Orange Wax Version) but my review is a draft pour from Toppling Goliath on release day, Mar. 31, 2018. ",4.85
Assassin,Rating applies to 2018 (orange wax) Assassin.,4.17
Assassin,"2014, gold wax. Dark chocolate, cocoa, brownie batter, oak, dark fruits and bourbon. Straight fudge. Awesome mouthfeel. Luxuriously thick and rich. Underlying bitter bite on the finish. Sweetness has mellowed and this has dried out. Still decently boozy. Very good. A bit of oxidation has crept in thou. I'd drink now.",4.56
Assassin,"I also had a chance to taste the 2018 batch (orange wax) today at Julio's poured by Clark Lewey. Tough to gauge look in small taster but looks super dark and sludgy. Smell is chocolate, sweet bourbon, some tobacco. Taste is chocolate, dark fruits and some roastiness. Also bourbon sweetness, but overall pretty subdued. Not much in the way of booziness. Medium mouthfeel with some good stickiness. Super excited that I got to try this.",4.81
Assassin,Got he opportunity to sample the 2018 batch before it was officially released at a tasting at julios Liquors. Very tasty tasty with big dark chocolate notes. A little on the thin side but delish nonetheless.,4.48
Assassin,"Assassin range a lot, this rating is based on the 2014 pappy aged assassin. ",4.73

Assassin,Gold Wax.,4.99
Assassin,"2016 Batch Pour from Iowa Craft Beer Festival in Des Moines, IA.",4.5
Assassin,"Purple Wax. Highly disappointed with this beer based upon the hype leading up to it. Its not a bad beer, just not nearly worth the effort to aquire it. It has great color,body and mouthfeel. The bourbon lays a little heavy (nose and palate) and creates an distracting imbalance. It was almost a clone of Olde Hickory's Event Horizon minus a couple abv points. ",4.29
Assassin,"Thing pours like tar and packs a massive punch. I split a bottle of the 2017 release with two friends and we were lights out. This beer resembles Dark Lord more than anything else, and honestly I think they're interchangeable. Get some if you can!",4.76

Very Green,"16oz can, dated 09.04.19, poured into a Tree House snifter glass. Enjoyed on 09.21.19, reviewed from Tasting Journal.",4.46
Very Green,Look exactly what I want an IPA to look like. Pillow like and yellow orange,4.86
Very Green,"Absolutely incredible NE style IPA from the always amazing Tree House. This one was one of my favorites from their extensive list. Canned date 8/4/19. Looks incredible, hazy yellow-orange turbulent color with some fluffy white head and beautiful lasting rings of lingering lacing that stayed put throughout the entire beer. Hard to beat. Smells great, deep ripe fruity hops - tangerine, grapefruit, mango, lemon, pineapple, melon, guava, passion fruit - as well as malt, piney and floral hops, caramel, bread and creamy vanilla. Taste follows the nose, excellent balance (as always) between the juicy fruity hop bomb and the sweeter malt backbone with that great creamy vanilla backing it up. Higher ABV so well hidden. The mouthfeel was just out of this world, creamy, juicy, smooth, sticky, luscious, coats the palate. One of the best I've ever tried. Just the right amount of carbonation. I will keep on my quest to try as many of their beers as I can.",4.64
Very Green,Canned 09/04/19 “the sweetest juice”,4.77
Very Green,"Its hard living near Treehouse because you tend to get spoiled with the ready availability of their beers. I have to admit, while there's nothing wrong with Very Green, it's not one that completely blows people away either. For all the gushing I've had guests do about the Juice Machine or King Julius I gave them, Very Green gets a fairly standard, 'It was very good.'",4.55
Very Green,"Canned 7/23/19, enjoyed in a tulip shifter",4.78
Very Green,"Quicker review, on tap at Tree House",4.4
Very Green,"Poured from a 16oz. can into a plastic cup (hey, we're on the driveway drinking). Just another in a long line of wonderful IPA from TH. The aroma is amazing and the wonderfully soft finish completes the experience.",4.5
Very Green,"I'm not a fan of Green, but this beer is a tasty treat. Good citrus nose, but the flavor just doesn't quite deliver what the aroma promises. Julius delivers. However, this beer is very rich, soft, and drinkable. Worth getting if offered.",4.25
Very Green,Canned on 6/4. Poured to Glass on 6/9.,4.5
Very Green,#NAME?,4.56
Very Green,"“Focus on today, you’ll find a way”",4.62
Very Green,"Very Green pours a thick and murky yellow orange with an off white one finger, dense and creamy head with big lacing retention. The smell is big tropical with pineapple and mango with a sweet citrus and some hop dankness. Taste is well balanced with sweet fruit from the American hops combined with the bitterness from down under. Excellent flavor with pineapple and orange coming through with a creaminess.",4.65
Very Green,"16 oz. can. Pours cloudy orange, just shy of murky, with a medium white head. Smells of pineapple and citrus with some alcohol and sweet pale malt. Tastes of pineapple throughout, especially as the alcohol flavor kicks in. Hefty orange citrus with a touch of sweet pale malt. Moderate alcohol kick. Big IPA, but good. I'd rather have regular Green, I think.",3.58
Very Green,Poured into a pint glass from a tallboy can.,4.85
Very Green,"Hazy, pale gold and orange beer. Tall, off white head leaves a curtain of lacing. Smell is an amazing blend of tangerine, pineapple, pine, caramel, and floral hop notes. Taste is the same as the smell with a great balance of bright fruits, sweet malts and a pleasant bitter finish.",4.9
Very Green,TREE HOUSE VERY GREEN IPA 4/29/19,4.78
Very Green,"When I opened a can there was a candied dankness greeted my senses like a dog greets their owner when they return home from a long day. After pouring a Golden full on haze the candied flavors open up to reveal mango, pineapple, grapefruit and bubblegum. The flavor is is all of this with a great balancing bitterness, pine flavors and light mouthfeel, that I think is what makes double ipas so great. The finish is a palate coating candied, hoppy, bitterness that makes you want another sip. One hell of a beer.",4.78
Very Green,"If I could get more KJ, it might be my favorite NEIPA, but as it stands, VG is it. It is like a tropical paradise in a glass. If they ever brew a vvvverrrryy green- I will go full 007 with disguises to buy it all.",5
Very Green,"Given the recent offerings, I was lucky enough to try Juice Machine, King Julius, and Very Green side by side, and all fresh. ",5
Very Green,"Another beauty from Tree House. Cloudy gold in the glass, substantial mouthfeel, good complexity as the Aussie and American hops alternately fight for your attention. Delicious citrus.",4.5
Very Green,"Been waiting to try this one as regular Green is fantastic. As expected everything from Green amped up in a very good way. More pineapple and tropical, full, creamy. Delicious!",4.73
Very Green,Pours a hazy yellow with a decent head and smells like a danky pineapple. Has a delicious pineapple flavor with a hint of sweet orange but a very balanced and not overly sweet finish. Amazing!,4.71
Very Green,"This is a very tasty brew, I get sweet mango, pineapple, not a lot of bitterness on the first smell & taste, very smooth blend of fruitiness. Man this goes down easy! Very drinkable, a new Tree House favorite for watching the Bruins!",4.75
Julius,Poured from a can to a pint glass.,4.61
Julius,"This is a very good beer. I wont lie, I was kinda underwhelmed at first because if the hype, but if I strip it down and put on blinders, not listen to haw amazing this beer is, that is when I rate it at one very good beer.",4.53
Julius,"Beautiful orange-heavy, juicy-as-hell beer with deep haze and almost no head. Nothing but sweet orange and dank grass on the nose. Not complex or layered, but gloriously juicy. Taste follows with sweet citrus juice, dank greens, pine resin, and a tropical stone fruit finish. Nice herbal notes as well. A little thin but silky smooth.",4.45
Julius,"The color on this beer is one of the brighter that I have had. Very juicy slightly hazy, enjoyed in plastic at the brewery. Notes of orange, tangerine, and very smooth finish.",4.9
Julius,"Phenomenal NEIPA. Easy to see why this tops the rankings for the style. Outstanding in every aspect. This was my second time trying Julius, and it's even better than the first time, probably because Ive had so many lesser NEIPAs in the interim.",4.67

Julius,canned 08-01-19,4.21
Julius,Maybe the only beer in my travels that lives up to EVERYTHING that was promised. ,5
Julius,"Lived up to the hype for me. Orange juice bomb, nice subtle sweetness, so smooth, beautifully balanced hop bitterness, immensely crushable. Not the best TH haze but could session this all day.",4.6
Julius,"From a can dated 7/16/19. This is a classic, and standard-bearing NEIPA. Had not had opportunity to get to TH for some time but finally made the trip and rewarded. The beer pours a hazy orange/yellow. Tropical fruits, subtlely so, abound. The smoothess of it comes apparent right away. The balance of the carbonation, hoppiness, and juiciness is so well done. A favorite.",4.69
Julius,Canned 7/24/19,4.53
Julius,"I'll start by saying I've never had tasty beer burps but, life offers unexpected twists sometimes. I might have to add a 5th category called Belch - I'll go 5. Finally made a trip to this brewery and while mayhem exists, it's well organized. The ale has everything you'd expect in a fine hazy NE IPA. A dense golden yellow pour with a small head that dissipates after a few minutes. The olfactory senses are blasted with delightful fruit from the tropics (mango, pineapple, papaya), a bit of citrus and a pleasant candy hint. Those notes are evermore evident in the palate while the citrus of the hops comes through along with some notes of stone fruit like nectarine. Feels absolutely lush on the mouth with a magnificent aftertaste. Splendid.",4.74
Julius,"Great intro to the NEIPA style. Julius has soft notes of orange zest and mango, making it quite delectable. Possibly the softest mouthfeel of any of their rotational beers. My personal favorite of their rotationals and one of their most consistent beers.",4.44
Julius,"I purchased a can of Julius directly from the brewery which was canned two days prior to the date of purchase according to the bottom of the can. The beer has a thick orange hue with a thin whitehead. It has a fruity scent of orange, mango and grapefruit. The beer has a very thick and smooth mouthfeel, velvety smooth. The taste was fruity and has similar flavors as the nose, I'm getting orange, mango and pineapple.",4.12
Julius,Let me start out by saying that many Treehouse beers taste sort of the same to me. I probably couldn't identify Haze from Super Typhoon from Julius or Julllius or Juuulius or Juliuuuuus or whatever bizzare iteration of vowels Treehouse slaps on the can. Julius was the first Treehouse I tried because its their flagship. I've had it from the can and on draft at the brewery. It's usually the beer I get for friends who ask to try Treehouse.,4.28
Julius,"Finally got to try this beer - the one I was looking forward to the most from my recent acquisition of a trio of Tree House offerings. And I have to say, I was a little disappointed - probably because my expectations were sky-high. I was expecting something even better than Green (which was outstanding) and unfortunately this one didn't deliver. It was still an excellent NE-style IPA, just not head and shoulders better than Green or even Haze. Canning date was 5/17/19, so still quite fresh. Looks great, nice slightly darker orange color with a fair amount of haze and very nice fluffy white head with lots of lingering lacing, not quite making it into sheets or rings but very close. Smells amazing, lots of deep sweet fruity hop aromas as well as some weaker piney and floral hops. Malt in the background, and a good hit of dankness towards the end. Tastes similarly - the fruit that I could detect included pineapple, passion fruit, mango, papaya, tangerine, lemon, grapefruit. So juicy and well-balanced, excellent tasting with good complexity and depth. Clearly enough to get a 4.25 rating from me, but didn't blow me away (to earn a 4.5) and didn't eclipse the Green or Haze flavors. Smooth, slightly sticky mouthfeel and just enough carbonation. Again, an excellent beer, certainly one of the better-tasting NE-style IPAs I've had, but just couldn't quite compare to the other Tree House beers I've tried.",4.34
Julius,It’s kind of unfair that I had king Julius before this but I still had to check this in...,4.21
Julius,"Murky orange in body, fresh powder head. Citrus, papaya, mango, grass in the nose. Citrus, papaya, mango, grass, clean bitterness. Heavy body with medium carbonation.",4
Julius,"Hazy opaque orange with one finger of creamy white foam that settles down to the thin cap. Aroma is a mix of orange, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, peaches and cream. The flavor starts with a flash of hoppy bitterness upfront, along with the citrus and other fruit notes from the nose. Some creamy sweetness follows, then dries out, leaving some bitter earthy hops and a subtle malt flavor. The feel of each sip is wonderfully smooth and creamy. A delicious and smooth beer that lives up to its reputation.",4.4
Julius,A: Pours a hazy sunset orange color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a nice cap that leaves good lacing,4.64
Julius,"""The Can That Stepped into Yesterday"" 3/06/19",4.71
Julius,"Julius is the first beer that I had from Treehouse. I enjoyed a draft after waiting for cans. The beer was balanced and very satisfying. The color, aroma, feel and taste came together like a symphony. The price was also very fair and I look forward to my next trip to pick up more beers from Treehouse.",5
Julius,"Thanks to BrutalFarce for this one in a ninja box. 16oz can (of course) poured into 14oz teku. Poured the expected murky yellow/orange/brown color of the style, with over 2 inches of fluffy, off-white head that had good retention and lacing. A lot of sediment settled to the bottom of the glass.",2.99
Zenne Y Frontera,"Drank season 17/18 blend no. 49. This is by far one of the best lambics on the market. Well balanced, flavorful beer. Our bottle had some carbonation and and great complexity.",5
Zenne Y Frontera,"Decanted at 3F. Perhaps the perfect all-around lambic drinking experience. Visually stunning- amazing bouquet. Taste was incredibly well balanced. Blends 3, 5 and 6 were all great, but 3 was my favorite.",5
Zenne Y Frontera,"Batch 2 so this was the solera. Little bit darker orange, great head. Great aroma of lambic and bright citrus along with some barrel. I could not pick out the sherry but could tell this was a different type of barrel then your standard lambic foeder/barrel that just has wood character. To be honest it really reminded me of Boon Vat 109 which is a great compliment to both beers. This was great, thankful to have a set of the new releases.",4.5
Zenne Y Frontera,"The beer pours a clear orange with no head. It smells and tastes of tart lemon, rustic funk, Sherry, and light cheese. Funky, but well put together and very easy drinking.",4.99
Zenne Y Frontera,"I've tasted several thousand different beers over the years. 10,000 plus check ins and at least that amount of different beers on a couple of other ""check in"" sites. Bottom Line: This is my favorite beer.....ever, to date. I can't say it's the best made or even the best beer I've had - it's simply my favorite. Amazing flavors, mouthfeel and finish. It has it all with great complexities and yet goes down easy and you want more. Good by itself or amazing with just about any food profile.",4.93
Zenne Y Frontera,"The nose of this showcases the sherry aged gueuze and the familiar drie funk. On the palate more of the same that funky cheesey gueuze goodness, grassy notes and tons of dark fruit and residual sugar from the sherry to finsh.",4.81
Zenne Y Frontera,"Sorry Contillon and Bokkenrijder, this is the best lambic I have had! Worth the hunt, worth the money, worth every single minute you give it. Wow! It is almost hard to put into words how much is going on, yet so much on a delicate scale. Plenty of sweeter red wine elements, grapes, sherry booze, lemon, plus other fruits like orange, peach and pear. Then there is the hay, earthy, and beet sugar base that crops up in fun and balanced sips. Plenty of funk, barrel elements and oak to boot. Little bit of everything, amazing!",4.75
Zenne Y Frontera,"A 750ml bottle, batch 2, bottled on 26th March 2016 and a best before date of 26th October 2026. Poured into a 3 Fonteinen funnel and decanter, decanted for 60 to 90 minutes and poured into a 3 Fonteinen Zenne glass.",4.8
Zenne Y Frontera,"Zenne batch 2 poured into a Torst glass. Golden orange in color. Not much of a head. Aromas of oak and sherry release from the glass. Picking a little citrus as well. Upon first sip, I’m speechless. So complex yet perfectly balanced. Oak, sherry and subtle nuances of funk and citrus. This is so easy to drink. Perfectly carbed and each sip is a treat. This is the best lambic I’ve ever tasted hands down. Amazing brew!",4.93
Zenne Y Frontera,Batch 2 - Solera,4.72
Zenne Y Frontera,Batch 1. 2015 vintage; drank 11/18/17 @ the Yarchives. ,4.25
Zenne Y Frontera,"batch 1, bottled 1/3/2014, decanted and served in a white wine glass",4.83
Zenne Y Frontera,"2014 vintage, poured into a decanter, at the Lambik-o-droom. ",4.9
Zenne Y Frontera,This is stellar lambic and one of the best new beer releases in recent years. The sherry barrels work magic. There's nothing to knock here save availability.,4.93
Zenne Y Frontera,Served at lambic o Droom . Decanted and enjoyed over an hour. Paired with two sherries that were in the barrels it was aged in. ,4.66
Zenne Y Frontera,Pours hazy amber with small white head.,5
Zenne Y Frontera,"Decanted bottle, poured into a taster. Pours a beautiful deep orange with a huge funky aroma. Super complex nutty notes without much carb, although it was not overly missed. Spectacular.",4.94
Zenne Y Frontera,"Pours a dull, burnished gold with a tight white band around the shoulders. Nose expresses must, a hint of oak and a trace of spirits. Taste consistent with nose. Mouthfeel is light, soft on the palate and almost still with a mild acidity. Overall, quite good; however a little carbonation would bring out the flavors and complexity in my opinion.",4.13
Zenne Y Frontera,"Amazing stuff. Had a couple pours at the Shelton Festival. A deep orange color. The nose is funk and sherry, and the taste is minerals, basement, wine and an uplifting note of fruit. Amazing stuff but some equally great beers that don't involve giving up a kidney.",4.74
Zenne Y Frontera,The best gueuze I ever had!! Great taste evolution in this one. ,5
Zenne Y Frontera,Amazing beer! The nose and taste had an exquisite balance of different cherry flavors. One of if not the best lambic I have ever had. Worth trying!,5
Zenne Y Frontera,"Can't help but compare it to Cantillon's Saint Lamvinus. And while I can respect the approach to a beer like this (and St. Lam), I personally don't enjoy wine all that much, which is probably why my rating suffers in comparison to most other's. Still, it's a fine beer/wine hybrid that I could enjoy in moderation.",4.14
Zenne Y Frontera,"Batch 2 Solera, decanted for 30 minutes. Almost clear golden color with a few big bubbles. Aroma has lambic funk, unripe fruits, vinous notes, wood barrel spiciness and dried dates. Taste starts sour, lemony and astringent with some stonefruit pit bitterness. Finish has a light cognac complexity but everything is really well integrated. Medium body with low carbonation but it's not flat by any means. I enjoyed this one more than the first batch.",4.6
Zenne Y Frontera,"cloudy punish orange with a white head. Aromas of some funk, some rubber, some cherry, vinegar, blood orange. Taste is sour with some minerality to it. The taste was much better than the aroma. Once you get used to the rubber smell, this beer is really great.",4.7
Zenne Y Frontera,"Unquestionably one of the great lambics I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. Beautiful rich wooden hue is accompanied by a sweet and deep sherry barrel aroma. Flavor is deep mineral water followed by tobacco, leather, and a lingering finish of orange marmalade. Not too sweet or too dry. Crisp on the tongue but retains the classic 3F carbonation. Lighter than some of the seasons, but heavier than other 3F gueuze offerings. A truly spectacular beer and a pleasure to drink. Not sure when I'll next get a chance to taste one of these.",4.85
Double Sunshine,"16 oz. can from Brewery (also sampled at Brewery): this one pours a cloudy slightly orange tinted golden color. Minimal head and lacing. The nose is good. A mixture of many hops with none overpowering the other. Tropical, pine, citrus and some floral/herb notes. A little muted from what I expected. The taste is wonderful. A plethora of different hops, all well balanced against one another. Some dank hops, with tropical, pine, citrus and maybe a bit of some herb flavors. Now real sweetness to this, just a bit of a dank hop bite. A really excellent beer.",4.34
Double Sunshine,"Pours a lightly hazy orange in color with a finger of tight white head. Aroma has grapefruit, orange, piney, and herbal notes. Taste hits the same notes as the aroma adding some tropical notes. Intensely hoppy yet super smooth. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Very tasty and drinkable. I’d absolutely seek this out again.",4.64
Double Sunshine,"DATE: September 26, 2019... OCCASION: drinking this in honor of a friend and beer companion who left our school for retirement to Vermont...thanks for introducing me to this and many other fine beers from and around the state... GLASSWARE: Duvel tulip... pours a picture-perfect orange amber body rife with effervescence... its head, a snowy peak of firm foam that settles into solar flares of ululance... how big can an aroma be? berry, lemon, mango, grapefruit, lush pine cone, pepper, garden herbs, dank basement, and a slight boozy conclusion... juicy draw, with a sip worth chewing... the teeth absorb what must be an 80+ IBU impact; its body couches arrogantly on the tongue; balanced and full in its finish, lasting if not resounding a half minute after its leaving... its presence evokes a bourbon, but its bite is more like a friendly embrace... BIG pine flavor, resin dripping and gum-splitting juiciness, with the citric shine blaring lemon, grapefruit, and other tropical rinds... this is brilliant, a beer that could be the companion for an entire evening, weighty but smooth, rewarding and flavorful... this is a perfect sendoff to Jeff, whose intellectual and pragmatic balance will be sorely missed in our neck of the woods..... thank you for sharing your gifts with us, and God bless, friend...",4.46
Double Sunshine,"08/08/19 Canning Date, purchased at Lawson’s beautiful, newish tasting room, which is well worth a visit for its wood-bedecked beer hall, very friendly staff, excellent local food, sunny terrace with cornhole, and, of course, excellent beer. Visited on 8/18/19. Double Sunshine is simply the most pleasantly pungent smelling, hoppy, and juicy (yet not too sweet) tasting Vermont double IPA. While Lawson’s Sip of Sunshine is now more widely available and has a similar (if more muted) taste profile, this one spelunks the nasal passages and does a hop-laden tango on the tongue. In a side-by-side comparison with Heady Topper, this is the more beautifully complex (albeit slightly less sweet to the taste) winner.",5
Double Sunshine,"I'm finally reviewing this excellent beer. I've had it a couple times over the years, but now it's out in cans, which is a great thing. A clear golden amber color with a thick white head that leaves considerable lace. Great aromas combining citrus, tropical notes and a little pine and herb. Taste is rich and hoppy with nothing off anywhere. Mouthfeel is just right...perfectly balancing a medium body and soft carbonation. Overall, a top notch IPA. I'm so glad it's now available in cans and not so hard to track down.",4.68
Double Sunshine,"(16 oz can, canned on 05/20/19, purchased in cold 4-pack... poured into a fat tulip)",4.41
Double Sunshine,Great beer. Sip’s older boozy brother with more pronounced citrus and dank hop character. Wish this could be in my steady rotation as my nightcap beer.,4.55
Double Sunshine,16 oz can poured into a shaker.,4.08
Double Sunshine,Excellent DIPA. Had on tap at LFL brew pub. Went great with food too. Smooth juicey NEIPA that had some west coast dankness. Full hop fwd in nose and taste; but nicely combined with malts. Beautifully well balanced. Rich dark orange mahogany colored with full creamy head that seemed to last forever. Picture post card for a classic looking beer. Full creamy feel but still was not heavy or sticky. Oh so in my wheelhouse. As balanced a brew as I have ever had. So glad to have had it fresh on tap. One of better IPAs I’ve had.,4.54
Double Sunshine,2/12/19 canning date,4.53
Double Sunshine,"Tasted from can. Pours slightly hazy amber orange with thick white rocky head. Aroma is tangerine and citrus notes. Taste is moderately to heavily bitter. Citrus flavors along with caramel, a little dankiness. Excellent ipa.",4.55
Double Sunshine,"Dark amber color with an off-white head which dissipates quickly, leaving a nice lace. I am not an expert at discerning the smell, but I can detect sweet citrus, and some sweet breadiness. Taste follows the nose. After drinking Heady on a regular basis (I live in VT), it's a treat to drink a DIPA that doesn't slam me over the head with hops. This beer has a nice balance between hops and malts. Easy drinking, alcohol well-hidden. Just a refreshing, hoppy well balanced beer. Well worth the :45 minute drive to Waitsfield to grab this gem!",4.64
Double Sunshine,"Lawson ups its Sip o' Sunshine ante. A mix of citrus and herbal flavors play off each other. Crack the can's flip-top, and abundant hop aroma goodness (almost) fills the room. Superior!",4.55
Double Sunshine,Poured into a 13 oz Alchemy Teku glass canned on 1/04/19. Pours a very attractive dark orange with a 1 finger plus sticky slightly off white head that leaves some thick rings of lace as it slowly settles. 5,4.71
Double Sunshine,"Unfiltered looking and orange with a finger off white head that leaves ribbons of lacing behind. Smells like sweet caramel, orange, grapefruit and a big blast of pine. Tastes sweet up front with a ton of citrus and pine. The finish gets some caramel, orange and piney bitterness. Great beer.",4.6
Double Sunshine,"Pours a semi clear golden/orange color. 2 finger slightly off white, very foamy head with excellent retention. Really nice lacing as the head dissipates in the glass. ",4.53
Double Sunshine,"poured from a 16oz can into a willi becher pint glass. pours a semi clear light amber with a finger of frothy white head. smells of pine, woods, a little hint of tropical fruit but it’s more piney and west coast than new england. taste is similar. pine, sharp bitterness from the hops but still quite drinkable. a tinge of caramel flavor. mouthfeel is spectacularly full and creamy making this DIPA all too drinkable. really takes this beer over the top for me. excellent old school DIPA. my favorite of the sunshines.",4.59
Double Sunshine,"Thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Not as complex as Sip of Sunshine, but still quite good. Here goes:",4.28
Double Sunshine,"Double Sunshine pours a nearly clear golden honey color with an inviting and thick, off white rocky head with some sticky lacing. The smell is packed full of citrus and tropical fruits; orange, guava, papaya with some notable floral characteristics, a nutty malt and an earthy and piney hop resin. The taste...phenomenal! Soft on the palette with an array of flavors from the juicy fruits, but also a mellow sweetness before the resinous pine. Well balanced finished very clean.",4.68
Double Sunshine,"Golden honey color only slightly hazy. Pure white foam, cover recedes to a thin cover later. Lace for days. ",4.29

Double Sunshine,"Picked-up a four-pack of cans at Kappy's in Norwell for about seventeen dollars. Have had SOS and Super Sesh. This is one of the best beers that I have ever had. Reminds me of my first taste of SOS, which, unfortunately, is way too inconsistent these days.",4.75
Double Sunshine,"Pours orange with a clarity that is nearly translucent with the first 12oz of the beer poured into the glass. It turns to a starburst opaque translucence when the final ounces are poured into the glass. Head is a finger and a half of white foam. Aroma is orange, tangerine, papaya, and light guava. Tropical citrus notes are heavy and out front, with biscuity, earthy, nutty malts and herbal hops adding a big backdrop. Flavor profile is orange, tangerine, papaya, and guava with notable herbal, floral hops and biscuity, earthy, nutty malts. Despite the naming of 'Northeast IPA', the hops are much stickier and less sweet than others of the style. Malts still serve as a backdrop, but not an after thought. It carries a quality balance between hops and malts, while leaning lightly towards the sweet side. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a crisp texture that touches on effervescent. Overall, very flavorful and surprisingly balanced. Reviewed per the New England IPA style due to its style listing on its profile at the time of review.",4.23
Double Sunshine,"Wow! This is phenomenal! Hazy and darker than a typical NEIPA. More bitter too, but that’s my favorite part. Soft mouthfeel as well. Don’t pass this up. I need to find more.",4.79
Double Sunshine,"Quick: pours a pretty orange gold with about two fingers of head. Break is somewhat quick,some lacing. Smell is phenomenal. Pine and pith and a really nice background sweetness. Taste is like the nose, with the pine and pith coming in intensely. Feel is spot on,a little light, great bitter finish.",4.56
Abner,12 oz draft pour at Churchkey in DC,4.31
Abner,"Opaquely hazy yellow-orange with a fluffy, lumpy white head that displays good retention and clings in ridges.",4.18
Abner,Poured into a pint glass from a growler filled the same day (Aug 10). Opaque and deep. Medium-bodied for an NEIPA and pungent in a piney/musky sort of way. Tasted like the apotheosis of the style. This is special.,5
Abner,"Excited to try this. Expectations high given its reputation. On tap at BeerShop, NYC.",4.75
Abner,"Drinking this in a dark bar so hard to get a good read on the appearance. Faint (very faint) notes of grass/earth and citrus rind on the nose, would expect more aromas from a HF IPA ",4.19
Abner,"L: Beautiful deep cloudy orange with 1 inch of frothy white head. Poured into a tulip glass from a growler, filled @HF the day before. ",4.96
Abner,"Growler fill dated February 2019 - very fresh. Beer doesn't appear to have settled at all - no floaties, no hop residue, no yeast. Lightly hazy in appearance, a bit gold around the edges, beautiful orange otherwise. Smells terrific - hoppy and citrusy.",4.56
Abner,"Abner is perfectly balanced and not a pure juice bomb. The nose is pineapple and pine. The taste is less citrus and maybe more pine. The finish is clean but not crisp, a bit of a sweetness. Overall an exceptional NEIPA.",5
Abner,"Had on tap at the Whetstone Station, Brattleboro.",4.49
Abner,"02/2014 - Huge grapefruit, some caramel, orange rind on the nose; great bitterness, floral, strong punch of pine, orange rind, and grapefruit; superb body that blows many stouts out of the water; the finish is dry, bitter, yet flavorful and balanced!",4.74
Abner,"After a hard day working, this is an amazing treat! Everyone knows how good this stuff is, and I’m equally impressed as everyone! One of HF’s best!",4.67
Abner,This beer is absolutely amazing. So refined compared to a lot of dipas. ,4.74
Abner,Had on tap and brought two 750ml growlers home. ,4.64
Abner,It's been awhile since I've had this one but I remember a hazy and enjoyable IPA from the NE. I don't think it was as fresh as I would have liked it but I was in Texas and can't complain.,4.33
Abner,"Thanks goes out to Satchboogie for this brew, again.",4.85
Abner,"I had this one a few months ago on a month old growler and wasn't impressed. Decided to just rate now having it fresh. Same balance I get, nothing too tropical, not too citrusy, slight bitter finish. Loved it.",4.79
Abner,"Finally got a chance to try this beer. I've had lots of other HF IPA's, but this one has escaped me, until now.",4.14
Abner,"Very cloudy with a brownish gold color. It looks like apricot juice except for the head, which is solid and lasting. Extensive spots and a few streaks for lace. ",4.39
Abner,"Poured from growler and consumed alongside barbecue salmon dinner. Cloudy pale orange color with a soft and frosty head that leaves a coating on the glass. Hoppy aromas including tropical and resin. Taste is delicious as expected with long lasting hops and a fair bit of bitterness on the finish. Mouth is just about right. Overall, a classic NE IPA.",4.33
Abner,"Poured from a 32oz growler into a tulip glass, one week after purchase. Appearance is hazy orange/brown and opaque with 2 finger thick head. Smell is a nice mixture of earthy hops and citrus (orange) with notes of honeysuckle, a touch of burnt sugar, and hay. I'm not surprised it is made with American hops. ",4.94
Abner,Look: golden orangish yellow with an inch creamy head,4.68

Bourbon County Brand Stout,Bottle date 15OCT14,4.75
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"First off let me say that I'm not a stout guy normally. It's too syrupy and one gives me a buzz and two gives me a headache usually. However, I am sucker for chocolate so I find myself drinking stouts on occasion. My favorite is Founders' KBS which adds a little liccorice/Basil taste into theirs. I also like Belching Beaver Chocolate Peanut Butter stout.",4.5
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"I went out and got this one after trying the coffee version. That was damn good. This is too, but to be honest I can't articulate precisely the difference. Lack of coffee, I would say. Read the other reviews. The ABV is high and this is bottle two so definitely I'll defer to the opinions of the wise folks below",4.5
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Pours black with nary a head, fine carbonation visible. Nose of malty bourbon. Flavor follows suit, very sweet followed by a wave of bourbon goodness. Hops are not really noticeable. Definitely a sipping beer and it gets better as it warms up. Drinking the 2018 version, booze is definitely noticeable but surprisingly not that hot. A good stout albeit rather expensive.",3.85
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"One of the best of the planet's dark beverages! Thick (used to be thicker). Incredible. My favorite was 2014, followed by 2015, then 2017. Seems they have off years and some inconsistency. Also the occasional quality control problem that they have done better than most to make up for.",4.66

Bourbon County Brand Stout,Review #600,4.51
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"This is the most delicious stout I have ever had. The most delicious alcoholic beverage I have ever had. I tried a Founders Breakfast Stout the other day and thought it couldn't get any better, but this one edges it out. It's almost hard to call this a stout as it tastes somewhere in between a stout and a wine. Sweet and heavy with vanilla and chocolate. Almost entirely black but with a slight amber glow. If you have the chance to try one of these you can't pass it up. ",5

Bourbon County Brand Stout,"22 oz bottle, 2018. Pours black with tall, long lasting, creamy, brown head and nice lacing. Aroma is of chocolate malt, toast, dark fruit, bourbon, vanilla and spices. Body is full, creamy and smooth. Taste is of bourbon, nutty, roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, brown sugar, dark fruit, vanilla and spices. Finish is long, massive and spicy. Delicious brew.",4.94
Bourbon County Brand Stout,My first taste of this legend. 2018 version. poured at cellar temp,4.45
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Finally cracked open this treat that I bought for myself over Christmas. Poured a dark chocolate with a one finger mocha frothy head that dissipated quickly to nothing. Aroma is faint molasses, chocolate, malt and bourbon. The aroma becomes more pungent as the brew warms. Taste is sweet malt, bourbon and caramel forward with hints of rich dark chocolate and dark fruit in the middle with black licorice, bourbon and burnt toast on the finish, which lingers. This is a real sipper . . . a thick boozy stout that makes your rear molars float. ;) OMG . . . I'm in love with a sexy woman with rich tastes that I cannot afford! Yet . . . I just have to have her . . . :)",4.66
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"I love a good stout such as Guinness Extra Stout or Young's Double Chocolate Stout, but this is overrated garbage. It has an overly sweet and syrupy taste that makes me gag at first sip. Imagine someone poured whiskey in your Guiness then added several sugar substitute(Sweet n Low) packets a splash of milk and then let it stew in a sweaty dorm room for a few days. Foul and one of the worst beers I've ever tried. Bought a 12 pack and gave away 9. Tried 3 times to be a convert, but am convinced people are afraid to say it's gross and not be considered a connoisseur.",1.29

Bourbon County Brand Stout,"I tried this beer for the first time tonight and all I have to say is WOW! I am a fan of Dragons Milk. This one is smoother, cleaner and just plain nice. The ABV is a little on the high side to drink more than one a night and that it is a seasonal those are its only down sides. ",4.65
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Dark as night. Tasty as hell. First one was boozy at the 15% mark, but after pacing myself on the next one a week or so later, I was impressed with the rich flavors and smooth finish. Great beer. I’d say take your time and enjoy one.",4.55

Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Great beer at 15$ a bomber, the vanilla is far superior, but somehow cost 7$ more.

But seriously, get the vanilla!",4.25

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"I went to the abbey last week, and brought two six packs home, $25 per six-pack. The best pure beer I have ever had. It is easy to add ingredients or to age beer in whiskey barrels to change the flavor, but that is not making pure beer.",5
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"I have often heard that if you make something hard to get or hard to find the public will want it all the more. I finally found this beer after realizing you cannot get it at their brewery and that the pub they serve it at across the street is often closed. I finally found it at an oyster bar in Ghent. It poured a nice brown with a good deal of carbonation. I found it was smooth, drinkable and enjoyable but completely overhyped. Tasted to me more like a German double than a Belgium quad and for the ridiculous price of 16 euro's a bottle it is a true avoid.",3.78
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"just thought i'd stop in and pile on. finally blessed to pop one open. it is no lie, all that they say.",5

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),I've tasted Westvleteren 8 first and then 12 right after 8.,5
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),Poured from bottle at home. I tried this once in 2017 and did not enjoy it quite as much as I do this time around. The carbonation was not as elevated in this current version which is nice. A real nice mix of sugar and spice.,4
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"After having it in the American gift brick from a number of years ago, now I'm finally in Belgium able to enjoy it at the source. The epitome of a Belgian quad. Brown sugar and chocolate with Belgian spices and a bit of raisin, exceptionally smooth and exceptionally complex.",4.71
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"It's just so damn drinkable. Tastes like a 7% abv beer, no sickly oversweetness or bitterness, or really anything. There's nothing that particularly stands out, and that's why it's so good. You just don't think about it much, it goes down so easily. Perfectly balanced creation.",4.72
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"I got to drink this across the street from the abbey. Luscious and full, I was struck by the balance between alcohol and sweet flavors. Simultaneously a liquid lunch and clean on the palate. The alcohol cleanses the palate after the cacophony of flavors of ripe fruits, caramel, and molasses. I was amazed that a beer this rich left me itching for more, as I would expect the richness to be over-satiating. Just the opposite.",4.7

Let's hope those months did not tinker negatively with the bevy of surprises this has to offer. ",5
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Had a friend bring it back from Amsterdam (hard to find there too!) Tasted a lot like the St Bernardus Abt 12 but with maybe less of a bitter aftertaste. A thicker head than most similar beers. Malty, rich flavor. Beautiful color.",4.57

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Huge aroma of dried cherries & figs upon first pour. Has the requisite Belgian yeast foamy head with lots of carbonation in the form of microscopic bubbles. A bit too carbonated & foamy for me, but a few quick swirls of the glass fixes that. Definitely a big beer, it is amazing this beer is made with only 4 ingredients.

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Pretty sweet for a beer. Very fruity and brown. Definitely an amazing beer and I was happy to be able to drink it. Out of a party of 7, we agreed that it wasn't that much more special than some of the current New England beers. But if you can try it, …., it is not overhyped. It's really that good.",4.85
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"L -- Pours a very deep amber body with total clarity. Very gentle pour produces three fingers of beautiful, thick pale tan head that retains and laces excellently. The canonical dark Belgian beer appearance",4.66
Dinner,Bottle: Poured a clear yellow color ale with a large white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of citrus hoppy floral undertones with some dry hops notes. Taste is also dominated by citrus hops floral undertones with some dry hops notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Enjoyable but hops were not as dominant as I was expecting. This beer has probably been surpassed by some of the newcomers.,3.86

Dinner,"probably one of the top 3 balanced IPAs I’ve had ever. even with all the other haze craze hype bombs out there, this bright citrusy piney yum juice kicks ass with its hop character and doesn’t decimate your gullet. Glad I finally tried it on draft and bottle. Win.",4.49

Honey colored, light carbonation and a rich creamy white froth in terms of appearance... The aroma can be detected without even bring one's nose close the glass... Citrus and melon with a touch of dankness... The flavor profile is hop forward, but no over powering, with a very light and limited malt backbone... A lot more piney hop presence than the nose would lead you to believe... Perhaps even a touch of pepper... The hop presence slightly intensifies post swallow... Mouthfeel is dense with a bit a chalky finish... Overall as expected - a well crafted hop forward expression that is a pleasure to sip and enjoy...",4.33
Dinner,"Pours a hazy medium orange with a half inch, well retained white head, fine visible carbonation and excellent lacing. Smells of tropical fruit , orange, pine and resin. Tastes of orange, grapefruit pith, mango, peach, herbal elements, pine and resin. Medium bodied and carbonation, dry and lingering bitter finish.",4.71
Dinner,"I have been waiting a long time to try this one. It is abou 4 weeks old, poured into a stemless wine glass. The taste/smell is tropical fruit (possibly mango), with some orange citrus. The beer starts with a nice malty sweetness, but ends with a strong piney/spicey bitterness. Medium mouthfeel for style, a little more carbonated then many of the newer age DIPA's. This one also pours very hazey, but not turbid. It is a light orange color, with a white head that leaves lacing on the glass. It was worth the $8 to try it, but willlikely never buy another bottle at that price. If however, I see it on draft somewhere at a reasonable price then I will try again. great beer that is drinkable and complex. The piney hoppiness/bitterness keeps me coming back for more.",4.74

Dinner,"The pour is hazy dark orange, semi-transparent, with a short white head and massive small bubble lacing. Nose is strong hop funk, resin and dank, tropical notes and garlic. The flavor is full of mango and peach, orange juice and a back end of grapefruit pith and resin. The feel is surprisingly clean, given the explosive range of hop flavors. This is a superb IPA that works with big dry hopping that is the cornerstone of the NE style.",4.65
Dinner,Not cloudy. That’s the point. Nice lacing over a slightly viscous golden body. Really great nose - one of the best I’ve smelled in a while with pure pineapple orange juice with some hints of rind. The malt on this beer compliments it well on the taste - almost a candy coating without being to much so or washing out dryness. Way too easy to drink. Damn good beer.,4.57

Dinner,"Hazy light yellow-orange, clearly effervescent, with a fat finger of thick near-white head. Sheets of lacing. Big orange and pineapple in the nose. A hint of cream, too. Light, tropical and delicious smelling. More watered down tasting — like most Maine IPAs — retaining the citrus and tropical flavors up front, adding in a weird semi-grassy bitterness and touch of mineral water. Tasty, but not as magical as the aroma. Lightly smokey herbs in the lightly bitter aftertaste. On the light side of medium bodied, especially for the style, with strong carbonation. Very good beer, with nice complexity in the taste, but still leaving me want a little more.",4.17

KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"Had on tap at BJ's Brewhouse in the Summerlin area of Las Vegas. Somehow I'd never had a chance to try it before, but I am certainly glad I finally did. A classic beer that truly lives up to its own hype.",4.44
KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),I love a good stout when it's still cold outside. KBS is by far my favorite. There's not even a close second. I only wish this were more readily available living in VT.,5

KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),Poured into my tulip this beer is dark. I mean dark. Darker'n a black steer's tookus on a moonless prairie night. Two finger foamy bubbly taupe-brown head slides down slowly leaving soapy lace on the glass. ,4.79
KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"Pours completely black, beige head. Small bubbles. Sticky lacing.",4.58
KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"It’s black, as dark as my house suffering through another LADWP power outage. Puny brown head. Aroma is just coffee & dark chocolate. Sweet with a touch of bitterness. Dark chocolate is the dominant flavor, then the coffee followed by cereal, bourbon, vanilla, oak & alcohol. Very thick & silky smooth with plenty of alcohol & carbonation to tickle the tongue. I’m a big fan of barrel aged & high alcohol content. This is way better than my typical breakfast.",4.5
KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"2019 Version: The most approachable year of KBS we've ever had. Its a toned done year, with less bold bourbon punch, but with more coffee and chocolate flavors. This is the most ""normal"" KBS has ever been, and that could be seen as either a negative or a positive.",3.83
KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"It's a good beer, but damn what an ugly label. I continually advocate for ""Label"" being a ratable value like Look Smell Taste Feel. I would give this 3.5. The Old Western font is hard to read and the whole thing looks like one of those ""Wanted: [Your Name]"" novelty posters you pick up at Frontier Land after panning for gold. But, it's a good stout.",4.05

KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"Thick - almost oozes from the bottle. Burned motor oil brown, with a one finger head swirling with different tans.",4.55
KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"From a 12oz. bottle, 3 1/2 month old. Poured with fluffy jamocha hued head. Color is typical stout dark, although there is a slight mahogany tint. Nose is bourbon, chocolate, cherry, very enjoyable. I poured it into a snifter, “someone told me to do it”, yes, it was good advice. The aroma is magnifico. Taste, is “bourbonesque” , chocolate dominates the coffee. ",4.33
KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"A bit more of the milky breakfast stout, but that one is really good. Upon pour, the head looked like rich chocolate ice cream, the liquid looked like a frothy cold brew coffee. Maybe the best looking beer I've ever seen (watch out my favorite Sam Smith Oatmeal Stout). Aroma is mostly bourbon with some nuttiness (probably the coffee). Taste was very much bourbon on bourbon. However, it's a bourbon with a lot of depth. Not enough coffee for my tastes. Only reason i didn't rank this perfect is because I'm not a 100% fan of Bourbon in my beer,",4.59
KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"2018 vintage sampled spring 2019. Opaque black with mahogany highlights and a 1/4 inch mocha head after a vigorous pour, recedes quickly, tiny spots of lace. Massive chocolate bomb, brimming with chocolate syrup and cocoa powder. Balancing notes of vanilla, whiskey, oak, coffee, toffee. The bourbon barrel is prominent but not overwhelming, complimentary to the dominant chocolate malt.",4.01
KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"Doesn't have the same flavor notes as a certain other Bourbon Stout which is released in November which I consider the gold standard. KBS is very good, but the flavor just isn't ramped to that level. For that reason, 4.25.",4.27

KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"2018 release, 12oz bottled on 02.15.18, 12.3% ABV. Served in a curved glass. Not big on aroma. Flavor has a rich malty thing with coffee and chocolate being very much secondary. Boozy but very easy drinking and dangerously so. Oak is present, but not overpowering, and vanilla is tertiary at best. Good, and probably much more widely available than in years past, but there are far better RIS out there.",3.85
KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"Poured black like dirty oil with a one finger tan fizzy head that quickly dissipated to a film. Aroma of brown sugar, dark chocolate, coffee and bourbon. Tastes follows the nose but explodes in your mouth with an added oak and an anise/black licorice finish. Then you notice how boozy this gem is. During the pour, you notice how it looks thick like dirty oil. However, the fell is not as oily as expected. It is very nice. The brew leaves a bit of nice stickiness on your lips. Very nice . . . one of the best I've had!",4.7

KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"L: murky and mysterious. Jet black, totally opaque. Good head retention, originally poured white large.",4.69
KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"It's KBS. It's Founders. Yes, it's as good as you've heard...or better. Much more available nowadays than in the past, but not any cheaper. It's worth it. I've had it on tap, 12's and bombers. Great beer, worthy of the hype. Bourbon, chocolate, coffee=awesome! Two thumbs up!!",4.83
KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"This beer definitely lives up to its description by the brewery. Bourbon is present. The flavor tastes rounded and ""finished."" It pours almost ink black, and the tan head manages to stick around for a few minutes. Smell is complex - again, with a bit of bourbon on the nose. It feels creamy in the mouth - almost like a milkshake, with light carbonation. High ABV - but it doesn't taste boozy. Definitely an elite stout.",4.35
KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),"Nice black beer. Aroma of coffee and cocoa. Molasses, coffee, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate in the taste. Creamy mouthfeel. A very nice bourbon barrel stout.",4.55
JJJuliusss,Pours a cloudy yellow/orange with a nice head and great lacing. Aroma and flavor are tropical & citrus fruit with some soft malt and a hint of raw/vegetal/green that is a tiny bit harsh on the palate. Very good but not quite what I was hoping for.,4.29
JJJuliusss,Limited quantity but well worth the wait. The golden hue of the glass already emanated a subdued tropical smell. The taste is like no other like champagne with strawberries. The texture of the beer is mid range carbonation bite with a flurry of memorable flavors. The question is how is this done in a glass of beer. The entire experience of drinking a can of this beer is like drinking a world class burgundy. The flavor and aromas seem to change as you drink the glass until there is nothing left but the aroma of a great beer. See you in line . . .,4.98
JJJuliusss,"16 oz. can. Murky orange. Smells of citrus and tropical fruit. Tastes of tropical fruit, slightly sweet pale malt, melon hops, and a little bitterness. Medium body. At some point, I think you can't taste more hops. It's an amped up Julius. Very good.",4
JJJuliusss,"Was kind of murky, not a bright NE as expected, but it didn’t carry any oxidized flavors or really anything other than ripe, juicy goodness. Good feel, very crushable",4.71
JJJuliusss,"Pours a hazy golden murky color, very protein rich. I feel like I am broken record for these TH reviews but it doesn't look great but it doesn't look terrible. There is good head retention. There's intense tropical aroma, I get mango and papaya. Oh yeah, that's nice . There's a touch of grapefruit on the finish, which provides some nice edge to the tropical nature of this beer.",4.43
JJJuliusss,"Pulpy orange juice. Smell is fresh squeezed oj. Taste starts with pulpy oj, mid is bitter marmaladde, finish is a touch of bready sweetness also maybe fruity lychee. Never mind definitely sweet lychee finish. Feel is classic soft TH. Overall it's fresh pressed oj with lots of pulp",4.79
JJJuliusss,"Tall can, from the source via a friend, canned 10/10/19...IE 4 days ago...",4.6
JJJuliusss,"Beautiful orange-heavy, juicy-as-hell beer with deep haze and almost no head. Nothing but sweet orange and dank grass on the nose. Not complex or layered, but gloriously juicy. Taste follows with sweet citrus juice, dank greens, pine resin, and a tropical stone fruit finish. Nice herbal notes as well. A little thin but silky smooth.",4.44
JJJuliusss,This beer was fantastic and hard to critique anything about it. Enjoyed in plastic at the brewery outdoors. Beautiful color of orange with notes of orange and tangerine on nose/pallet. Get while you can!,4.94
JJJuliusss,"Another incredible juicy, hazy, pillowy soft New England IPA from this amazing brewery. This one did not disappoint, and actually I would rate this as one of my top three IPAs ever (along with Green and Doubleganger). Canned date 8/1/19 so this was quite fresh. Pours a very hazy, cloudy yellow-orange, nearly opaque color with a little white fluffy head and some spotty lingering lacing. I would have given it higher marks for appearance if there were more lacing present on the glass. Smells absolutely amazing, lots of ripe fruit - grapefruit, pineapple, mango, tangerine, papaya, guava, passionfruit, lemon and a little melon. Also a good hit of floral hops, herbal hops, creamy vanilla, bread and malt. Taste follows the nose, and again there’s a trademark Tree House creaminess, juiciness and amazing blend of hoppiness and sweeter malt backbone. Mouthfeel is very tough to beat, amazingly pillowy-soft, as others have described. Very luscious, sticky on the palate, smooth and perfect amount of carbonation. Truly an awesome beer.",4.61

JJJuliusss,"With Julius seems it is love hate thing, well this is pure love. nice big hop noise of that citrus and just enough malt sweetness to balance it all out. The look poured in a class was a little more muddle/murky but the flavors made it up for. Too bad this was only 2pp.",4.64
JJJuliusss,"God this is good. Orange rind on the coloration, such orange zest on the nose. Orange and Mango coat the palate like julius, but jjj does it in a much more full way. Much more full bodied than the classic, but doesn't quite pack the punch that KJ does. It's a very nice balance. Excellent beer.",4.84
JJJuliusss,"Opaque tan-yellow with a large, airy off-white froth settling to a lumpy uneven blanket leaving spiderweb lace.",4.62
JJJuliusss,"Pours a murky, turbid white-orange with two fingers of dense, white foam with little fluffy islands retaining a long while. Aroma is tangerine, nectarine, orange, mango and lemongrass for a puree of tropical fruits. Malts are obscured by the hops and are nonexistent. Flavor profile carries a little more sweetness forward, again, with a lengthy list of tropical fruit descriptors - mango, nectarine, tangerine, orange, mandarin orange, lemon and guava. A little residual sugar sits on the tongue, akin to eating a ripe mango or tangerine. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a fluffy, lightly grainy texture. Overall, aroma is big tropical fruits, but the flavor profile drives it up a notch. ",4.61

JJJuliusss,Canned 2 months ago. ,4.45
JJJuliusss,"poured from a 16oz can into a stemmed bulb glass. pours a foggy, murky orange. good amount of white foam and decent lacing. smell is a heavenly bouquet of ripe tropical fruits. taste leaves a little something to be desired. it’s not a bad tasting beer, but the nose is so explosive that you expect the same from the taste. instead, it kind of dies off in the back end. doesn’t pop like regular julius does. feel is top notch, as per usual with most tree house IPAs. overall, beyond decent beer but worth going the extra mile for when you could get 12 regular julius? no. essentially julius with an amplified nose, perhaps slightly better looking in the glass and not as good of flavor / taste.",4.48
JJJuliusss,"Beer from Tree House never seems to fail when it arrives at my front door. Love having a pipeline to their beer, by far my favorite brewery, even more than the good ones we have in California.",4.6

JJJuliusss,"Hazy mango flesh color. Good retention and spotty lacing. Smells of citrus fruit, grass and some dank as it warms. Bright citrus fruit, peach and apricot flavors. Loads of hop bitterness which lingers a loooong time. Medium bodied with a refreshing fizz feel. Definitely not a creamy textured beer, in my opinion. Can't compare it to other Tree House IPA's. It has a style of its own. It's great...",4.38

Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,Poured from a cracked bottle (damaged during shipping) into a styrofoam cup in the parking ramp over my work lunch hour. After I opened the stained shipping box to find that the bottle still had about 6 ounces in it I decided I just had to try this. Glad I did. Amazing beer loaded with chocolate. Creamy and smooth. If not for the acquisition cost I'd go after another of these.,4.75
Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"Those of you that actually read past the fact sheet on my reviews know that I carry a strong inherent bias against pastry stouts because I don’t handle sweetness very well. Some of you may have also noticed that I don’t seem as disenchanted when it comes to barrel-aged stouts and barleywine, when they sometimes taste as sweet, if not sweeter than other representations of pastry stouts available on the market.",4.45
Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"Dark black with a pretty thin tan head. Smell is pure vanilla and coconut. Taste is out of this world, one of the best things I've ever tasted, period. Coconut up front, smoothing out into pure chocolate flavor that really does taste like German chocolate cake. The only knock I'll give it is that the barrel doesn't come through a ton in the flavor, but it's hard to call that a negative when it tastes this good. Pretty sweet, but not painfully so. Smooth feel, maybe I'd like it a little bit thicker, but again - this is just quibbling and it's hard to really knock this at all. Fantastic.",4.99

Taste follows the nose, rich milk chocolate, coconut, get a little oak/bourbon note. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth. Overall, delicious stout. As I’ve stated on several of my BA AC reviews, the only knock this beer is there is not a big barrel presence here. Otherwise, fantastic.",4.66

Aromas of fudge and subtle coconut release from the glass. Smells like dessert! Flavors are insane. Pretty sweet with fudge brownies, coconut and subtle Barrel/oak. Amazing flavors here. Like I’m sipping on brownie batter. Feel is viscous and mouth coating. Pretty sticky. Overall, this was a treat. Dessert in every way!",4.75

Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"Great beer, but I have to say for the value and what I gave up to get this I would rather go for the non ba version. Great beer, where I think the bourbon barrel actually does not add a lot cause there are so many adjuncts. Definitely a chocolate bomb. Gets points because of Angry Chair's dark lacing and overall turbid, oily, thickness that makes it a unique beer.",4.38

Parabola,2019 Edition 12oz bottle.,4.19
Parabola,"Prefer this one to the 2018. Dark chocolate and coffee are the stars while the bourbon is pretty subdued. I would imagine if this was aged for at least a year, the bourbon and wood flavors would come out more. Perfect mouth feel. Extremely bitter which is the only flaw I can speak of.",4.47
Parabola,Exceptionally mellow for a 2019 vintage. Probably the thickest pour I’ve ever seen. It almost oozes ib the glass. Completely opaque with very little head. Boozy coffee on the nose. One of the booziest tasting stouts I’ve had. Lingering bitterness in the finish reminds me of espresso and dark chocolate. Not the most complex stout I’ve had but what there is is as good as it gets.

There is a kiss of char at the back, but otherwise, the heat from the alcohol and bourbon are low. Mouth feel is thick with a velvety texture that is broken up by a hot, grainy texture. Overall, a huge and superb stout wedded with notable bourbon and flavorful coffee. ",4.69

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,"Had a pour at Dark Lord day and it was pretty good. Not long before I had BA abraxis and BA darkness, both were better. To me this beer should not be ranked this high",4.2

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,"Pitch black pour, smaller tan head. Gobs of lace. Aroma of rich coffee, roasted malt, whiskey, fudge. Taste is nearly indescribable....

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,Just like cold brew with lots of chocolate and vanilla. Mouth feel is silky and substantial. Excellent barrel character with toffee and butterscotch without the alcohol burn. No bitterness from the coffee. Easy drinking and we'll worth seeking out.,4.71
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,"A sexy beast. Poured pitch black; not much different then their other stouts. The aroma is outstanding. All coffee - it contributes strong notes of hazelnuts. There is trace notes of bourbon which adds the complexity to the coffee. Smells sweet and dessert-like, like Tirimisu. Upon sipping, the coffee is exactly like the aroma. Full-blown hazelnuts with trace bourbon. I admit I never tasted coffee like this in any other stouts. The coffee adds so much flavor yet I appreciate its simplicity as the hazelnuts are so easy to pick up. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and rich. Outstanding beer, well crafted!",4.72
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,"Wow, just simply wow. Had this even after a full line up of BA stouts and getting to palate fatigue this one stood out. Great coffee nose like a true Caffe de Monde Vietnamese coffee complete with evaporated milk thick creaminess. For those who know what a vietnamese coffee is can relate to what this means. Just super coffee and bourbon forward yet balanced and full mouth creamy feel. Simple Superb!",4.69

Morning Wood,"Pours a jet black. Aroma is wonderful mix of bourbon, maple, coffee & caramel. Very pleasant. I lingered over the smell much more than usual. The taste was equally pleasing and quite complex. It comes at you in waves. Starting with the sweet maple with brown sugar, caramel & chocolate, and then shifting to a more roasted flavor to go with the coffee. All the while a constant bourbon flavor. Simply awesome. Medium to full body.",4.75

Morning Wood,"Poured jet black with a thin mocha head. The smell of coffee, maple and caramel flood the nose.

Morning Wood,"Pours black with a finger of caramel-colored foam. Head retention is poor. Aroma is maple syrup, coffee, chocolate, cocoa, oak, and roasty and toasty malts. Very deep aroma with a springy sweetness. Flavor profile is roasty, toasty and caramely malts and medium-roast coffee, chocolate, cocoa, maple syrup, toffee and caramel. A touch of bourbon and its heat and woody oak balances out the sweetness a little. It's sweet, but not overly sweet. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a very smooth and lightly creamy texture. It's thickness and consistency is medium-thick. Overall, maple syrup and coffee is huge and pairs well with bourbon. Heat is minimal, especially when considering the 11% ABV. ",4.4
Morning Wood,"Pours a pitch black coloration with a large, creamy head. Smell is quite sweet and dominated by maple syrup, with hints of lightly roasted, caramel malt and chocolate, coffee and bourbon notes. Taste follows the nose, being quite sweet and absolutely dominated by maple syrup and caramel, lightly roasted malt, with lighter notes of coffee, chocolateand lovely vanilla bourbon notes, as well as a certain earthy, woody oak presence. Finishes bittersweet, with a light bitterness and an almost cloying maple sweetness lingering in the aftertaste. Thick mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation.",4.15

Morning Wood,"Overly hyped. Way too sweet, all I tasted was maple syrup and lactose. Tons of vanilla make this beer hard to drink. Not impressed when Goose Island BCBS is available in Florida on tap at local brew pubs.",3.61
Morning Wood,"Poured a black body with no head and almost no khaki lace, either (quite thick). The aroma has a touch of wood and coffee but mostly I pick up maple syrup. Thick body but not sticky/cloying thick, the maple syrup is dominant flavor although one could say there is a buttery taste from the barrels (hint of vanilla sweetness) and touch of bacon. Don't really pick up any coffee notes as to me the beer is more sweet and woody, although I also don't pick up any booze and this is mostly a sweet dessert beer to me.",4.18
Morning Wood,"Pours quite dark with a nice mocha head. Aroma is heavy maple syrup with intermingled coffee. Very nice chocolate flavor that is swiftly overcome by the maple syrup, coffee is in the background and is perfectly balanced in the mix. Quite sweet. Barrel aging is not as dominant as I like from this brewery (thinking Last Buffalo in the Park). A bit overcarbonated IMO. Overall definitely worth a try, not worthy of the BA #33 ranking., but definitely a top 100.",4.29

Lou Pepe - Kriek,"On tap at Moeder Lambic, first one in a lambic glass, second in a tulip. Deep red with virtually no head. Mild cherry and lambic smell. Taste has a nice complexity that stands out even in the middle of a Zwanze day’s worth of cantillon. A real treat.",4.75
Lou Pepe - Kriek,"Carnivale Brettanomyces 2019. Small size sample from bottle in de Bierkoning, Amsterdam, poured by the man himself: Jean Van Roy. 2014 label, bottles 2016.

Flavour is sour, with light dry bitterness. Light bodied. Long finish, tart and dry.",3.97
Lou Pepe - Kriek,"From bottle at brewery. Beautiful Ruby appearance with a dense pale pink head that retains and laces far better than I've ever seen for the style. Smells like cherry pie filling. Flavors strike a wonderful balance between a gentle graininess, tart cherry, and bretty funkiness. Amazing complexity with a nice drying finish that tapers off quickly. Pricey but understandably so ",4.59
Lou Pepe - Kriek,"05/2016 - this is fucking incredible. Cinnamon, tart acidic cherries; slightly sweet, very fruit, and only a light amount of acidity; great funk, oak, and barnyard in back; clean and delightful.",4.65

Lou Pepe - Kriek,"Was surprised to be able to find a 2012 750ml that could be consumed on site at Hill Farmstead. Beer is a murky ruby red in glass with pick 2 finger head. Aroma is a blend of sweet fruits and earthy funkiness that blends really nicely together. Taste is amazing. A perfectly blended mix of all the good things I like in a Belgian Lambic/sour and done better than most any I've had to date. It's only slightly sour, mixed with tartness and sweetness from the fruit, but finishes so clean. No syrupy sweetness on the back of the tongue like you get from some other fruit beers. It was quite the highlight of my Vermont trip to finally get to sample something from Cantillon and if I can't have it at the source in Belgium, then sitting at Hill Farmstead on a 75 degree sunny fall day sure isn't too shabby a venue either.",5

Zombie Dust,"
Its quality lies in its simplicity. Superbly balanced for what the American Pale Ale should be.",4.29
Zombie Dust,Amazing beer. Definitely the best APA I've ever had.,4.83
Zombie Dust,"Waited to try this beer for years and then kind of forgot about it. Suddenly it appears on local shelves. It is pretty good for only having the terrible Citra hop being used (I am sorry but Psuedo Sue is terrible). I would describe this as the original juicy pale ale before the haze craze came along. It also has the benefit of having bitterness and not being overly sweet. Would I drink this regularly? Probably not as I am more in the pine, herbal, earthy, dank spectrum with hoppy beers.",4.04
Zombie Dust,"Long time favorite. Once almost impossible to get. A well balanced pale /IPA. A bit hazy, juicy but balanced out with some righteous pale ale bitterness. The pendulum has swung too far to the Uber neipa side, while Zombie Dust has remained strongly perfect and has done nothing wrong.",5
Zombie Dust,**,4.09
Zombie Dust,Not much to say that hasn't been said. My personal favorite beer and the beer I personally chose to have at my wedding. The pinnacle of an IPA and a modern masterpiece.,5
Zombie Dust,"There have been so many reviews about this that I probably can't add to the information about it but I can say it has been very high ranking for so many reasons that I agree it is superb, excellent, wonderful, and other superlatives. They use all Citra hops which happens to be one of my favorite varieties for just enough bitterness and explosive deliciousness. There is a fine line of too little and too much but this has the sweet spot of exactly the right quantity of hops to make this beer so thoroughly enjoyable.",5
Zombie Dust,"On tap: Carmel in color with a small head and decent lacing. Smells of citrus and pine. Pretty hoppy but good malt backbone. Pine, citrus and malt all come together to make a great beer that's flavorful without being bitter.",4.72
Zombie Dust,"Wanted to try this for a long time and was lucky to find some fresh on a recent trip to the Midwest. Pours a much deeper color than I expected, a burnt orange with a smallish head and just a little lace. Nose is certainly muted for such a highly rated beer. Some orange and earthy/herbal notes along with caramel malts, but much more subdued than I hoped for. Hard to believe this is an all citra beer. ",3.88
Zombie Dust,"Bottled 6/21. Pours a clear amber with a thin white head. Pungent hop aroma and not much else. Bitter and floral hop notes with caramel malt notes on the taste, hops mellow out and become more floral and grassy as it warms. Evolves more than a lot of pale ales, and more complex than the nose would lead you to believe. Medium bodied and soft carbonation. Definitely a great beer.",4.13
Zombie Dust,"I used to get this for $35/case at the brewery, then I got tired of it and craft beer passed FFF by. Too many comparably good options for much less money. Now that ZD actually stays on the shelf, it's become difficult to find fresh bottles. (Bottle dated 6/12 being drank on 7/1) Does the nostalgia hold up? The balance of the beer is what's key. Too many FFF beers have the same flavor, but the bitterness, malt, carbonation are just right with this. It's still too expensive, and I don't consider overpaying for beer to be 'treating' myself. But if some are content to pay more than $100 to see an 80-year-old Stones cover band, I guess I won't be judged too harshly for this pit stop. But I'm done. Felt like a douche sleeping with an old flame when I bought it, and I still feel dirty having drank this.",4.1
Zombie Dust,"Very nice pale ale from a famous brewery that’s new to me. Tried this one on tap at 3 Floyds. Looks great, slightly darker golden-yellow-orange color with a little white head and nice rings of lingering lacing. Very nice aromas - lots of juicy grapefruit, mango, pineapple, tangerine, lemon and passion fruit fruity hops along with some floral and piney hops, nuttiness, caramel, vanilla and malt. Taste follows the nose, and there’s a great balance between the hoppy bitterness and smooth sweeter malt backbone. Good hit of bitter hoppiness at the finish. Smooth, mild, ever so slightly sticky mouthfeel. Good amount of carbonation. Really a great beer - not a 4.5 by any means, but truly very enjoyable.",4.34
Zombie Dust,"Appearance: Pours a glowing, but not bright,orange/amber color like an ember from a dying campfire.",4.33
Zombie Dust,"12oz bottle. 4/30/19 bottle date. Appearance: Dark golden orange, cloudy, with a fluffy white foam head and decent lacing. ",4.08
Zombie Dust,"So, let's dispense with the BS that this is an APA - it's an IPA - and a damn good one!",4.5
Zombie Dust,"The clear golden amber beer pours out into a Duvel glass with a 1/2” off white head that recedes slowly to become a cap of foam and then a thin irregularly shaped island of foam and a ring round the glass while leaving a web, rings and sheet of lacing on the sides of the glass. Sipping creates a couple of long small arches and lots of small patches and slender legs of lacing.",4.25
Zombie Dust,"This pale ale pours a dark, burnt amber color with modest finger and a half of soapy, rocky head that quick dissipates. The smell is a potpourri of floral notes, as well as citrus from tangerine and an orange juice quality to grapefruit and pineapple with a hint of papaya and mango. A touch of pine on the nose from the Citra hops, as well as a malty, cake batter or light vanilla sweetness to it. Up front, it’s earth and green with a mild hop dankness to it. The beer opens up with bready and caramel body with a slight tropical fruit note of pineapple and mango. Zombie Dust has a clean and crisp mouthfeel to it, with a resiny and bitter, but dry finish to it. Could drink this beer all day long.",4.6
Zombie Dust,"In a blind taste test with really average IPAs we failed to pick this out of a lineup. It may have been king one day, but the hype is unmatched. Had a 2 week old six pack too. Either beers have come up a long way or this one has fallen. Not at all impressed.",3.82
Zombie Dust,"Definitely a beer I would like to have regular access to, but alas, I snagged this bottle on a trip to Cincinnati.",4.29
Zombie Dust,"Pours a golden amber color with a couple finger's worth of sudsy, off-white froth. The aroma is equal measures citrus and pine resin, with a bready underpinning. Wisps of yeast swirl and dance as gravity slowly overwhelms the rising carbonation, while rings of reticulated lacing adorn the glass.",3.36

Westly,"2017 bottle poured into a SARA bulb. Bright orange with some haze. Small white head forms and dissipates quickly. Smell is of stonefruit, funk and acidity. Taste is amazing. Ton of stone fruit, subtle funk and acidity. Super balanced. Feel is very nice. Actually found this to be a little “thick” and was very effervescent with the bubbles. Overall, this is an outstanding beer and deserves the hype. Thank you George for sharing!",4.69
Westly,"This has a beautiful apricot color with deep stone fruit flavor and refreshing medium mouth feel. It's very balanced and well made, just don't expect anything super complex. I don't see the need to pay the price to acquire this, but it's certainly a very good beer.",4.5
Westly,"2015 B2. Had at apricot share with about 35 other apricot sours and siasons. Top notch apricot saison. Thought the finish is what separated it from other apricots. Great smell, and terrfic light airy, not that sour. I woulds say this and La Fosse B2 one the share for me. I love Fou but 15 was a little lack luster compared to westly.",4.81

Westly,"Pours a orangish yellowish hazy color. Mild head retention. Smells of acidic apricots with a nice barnyard funk. Taste is incredibly balanced with the tart, acidity predominate but very smooth. There is not much alcohol taste with this high ABV. One of the best wild ales I have ever had.",4.78
Westly,"Ok this looked more like orange juice than any beer I've ever seen. Nice, pulpy orange juice. Aroma was of citrus lactic sourness. ",4.47
Westly,"wow! thanks to drlovemd87 for sharing this rare gem, its always a pleasure to get to share these with close friends. this might represent the final evolution of the apricot wild ale, and after being only lukewarm on the west ashley (in regards to all the hype), this one really takes it to the next level. twice the apricots and twice the time in barrels! the pour is hazy short of rusted orange, pale and soft looking, no visible particulate in here, but still sort of raw looking. nearly a full inch of airy white head lingers. the aroma here is near perfection, about is forward as apricots have ever been, including allagash, cascade, crooked stave, and yes, cantillon too. its juicy and bright, sweet enough, even fuzz on the outside just a little bit. oddly nutty like the pits but that could be a handover from the wood. the fruit is pulpy and ripe and dominant, but there is a great mixed culture sourness backing it up, cutting the sweet, and highlighting some of the wheaty grain base and oak treatments, all well integrated and powerful, but also quite mellow and approachable as they go. the flavor is still really ripe apricots and interesting funk and sour combined. the fruit is incredible here, maybe a step short of its explosive aroma, but really pungent and to the point. it tastes like a fresh apricot in the peak of the season, as true to the fruit as any of the beers out there. its quite sour too, a lot of lactic acidity, ahead of the wild funk aspects, and well ahead of the oak. it gets even more sour as it warms, which it does in this instance because i cant put my glass down to stop smelling it! a bottle of this might be a lot as a solo mission, so i was really glad to be sharing it. i could see the acidity getting overwhelming. its like too much of a good thing, a third of a bottle was exactly perfect. probably the best expression of apricots i have seen in a beer, and the white wine notes from the wood and the yeasts are a great compliment to the fruit. easily the best of the beers i have had from these guys, and probably the new benchmark in the style. unlike the west ashley, this is entirely worth all of the high praise it gets! a memorable experience.",4.55
Westly,"A delicious beer indeed. Bright orange color pours with virtually no head, juicy fresh apricot and hay nose, bright stone fruit vinous juiciness with a funky tartness that just leans on the edge of sharpness. In a vacuum, this beer certainly stands on its own merits. However, I can't help but to weigh the vast difference in the cost of admission versus West Ashley/Fou as compared to the difference in quality, which is, in my humble opinion, marginal.",4.56
Westly,"On tap at CBC 2016. Pale golden with a thin white head. Apricot, brett, some citrus and fruit sourness. A good sour beer, but not as good as the hype surrounding it.",4.25
Westly,An amazing beer! I was able to have Westly at two different tastings a few months apart. The first time side by side with West Ashley. Kicks WAs ass...the Westly is just that much more complex and amazing! Tons of fruit!!! 2nd time it was side by side with Abricot Du Fermier and again Westly was triumphant!,5
Westly,"Desert island beer right here. These guys have some great bugs and it shows big time here. I would take this against a Fou all day and I think that says a lot. Massive fruit flavor, low acidity. A+ all the way. Get this. Drink and enjoy. Repeat. (If you're lucky)",4.92
Westly,"Probably my favorite fruited sour to date. The color is a golden orange. Smells of fresh apricots. The taste follows the smell, huge apricot bomb. Slight amount of funk that gives the beer great depth. Wish SARA made more of this. The hype is real and I will continue to seek more of this delicious juice.",4.98
Westly,"Batch 2, 2015. One of the best fruited sours I've had. Had this side by side with a couple other stone fruit beers, Fou, Leaner, etc. This was by far the best. Fruit was prominent, funk played a backseat but it worked so well for this beer. Just lovely. Blows West Ashely out of the water.",4.74
Westly,"This beer was pretty tasty. Was not as acidic as I thought it would be (a good thing). Taste was awesome. Was it worth the hype? Probably not, but glad I was able to share this beer with a friend!",4.6
Westly,Looks like apricot nectar but a little brighter. The smell is lemony with some fresh apricot peel. The apricot is sharply acidic out of the gate like underripe peel then balances into a fleshy finish. The base beer is quite complex like a hybrid of a farmhouse ale and a wild ale. The acidity is clean like the fruit added to the tartness level.,4.46
Westly,"Hazy light orange. The nose is all apricots with a strong sour punch. The taste has less sour than the nose, with a smooth apricot taste. The feel is very juicy and clean. Overall a very great beer.",4.71
Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout,"2018 vintage, dated 04SEP18, clocking in at 14.9% ABV; it pours pitch black color with a 2 finger brown colored head that fizzed and made crackling sounds, fading rather quickly and leaving minimal spotty lacing. A weak looking head for a BCBS variant.",4.7
Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout,"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours nearly black, appearing opaque black in the glass with a thin brown head that dissipates to patches with light lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, vanilla, mild cocoa and bourbon. Flavor follows, with dark toasted malt, fresh tasting vanilla, a hint of cocoa and bourbon with some light oakiness in the finish. Medium bodied with light creaminess. Well, it's time to drink and review my last two BCBS variants from 2018, because the new batch is around the corner. I was a little nervous about this one because, while I like a touch of vanilla in stouts, I'm not a fan of over use of vanilla flavor. The vanilla here is a dominant component and tastes like fresh vanilla smells, but it blends nicely with the base BCBS. Mission accomplished, a fine vanilla imperial stout and a worthy variant of this classic stout. That being said, I'm not sure this is a big improvement on the stock Bourbon County and has a little less Bourbon character, which is one of my favorite parts of the regular stout. ABV is warming, but deceptively covered. Flavorful, well balanced and a gem of a stout.",4.36
Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout,"Pours black with a thin fresh khaki head. Smell has Vanilla Molasses,wood bourbon and roasted chocolate. Taste has vanilla nicely integrated into this stout it blends well with the chocolate,bourbon and wood. Nice thick mouth feel of the BCBS with the vanilla added very nicely.",4.25
Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout,"The look was jet black with a small tan head. The smell was vanilla, oak, and chocolate. So sweet. The taste was very sweet vanilla and alcohol up front followed by some rich decadent thick chocolate. So delicious. The mouthfeel was deep and slick with low carbonation. This might be my favorite variant so far.",4.84
Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout,A: Jet black with small amount of foam and light lacing. ,4.06
Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout,It doesn’t get much better than this. Pours black with perfect carbonation. Cookie dough vanilla and overall brownie batter taste with the barrel. Perfect stout feel. It’s incredible - hard to find more words.,4.71
Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout,"The look is consistent with pretty much any Bourbon County beer - pours think, pitch black, with just a touch of head that fades quickly. The aroma on this one is just incredible. Vanilla dominates and it's a sweet like vanilla cake or cream. Oak, chocolate, dark fruits, and some coffee are there as well. Fortunately, the dominate vanilla nose doesn't carry over to the taste. It is definitely there, but if it were as strong as the aroma it would be overwhelming. It's very smooth for the ABV, mostly hidden by the sweetness. Feel is on point and just like the appearance, consistent with others iterations of Bourbon County. Overall, this was very enjoyable. After BCBCS, this has probably been my favorite. The aroma is its best attribute IMO.",4.59
Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout,"1 pint .9 fl oz, 9/4/18 14.9%, poured into a tulip glass. Pitch black. Just a thin rim of lace. Aroma of bourbon, chocolate, and vanilla. Vanilla chocolate cake, with some heat. Taste is brownie mix. Vanilla. Chocolate. No soy sauce like some of the 18 regulars I have had so far.Carbonation low, sticky, dense. #800. A welcome variant , especially if you like vanilla sweetness.",4.41

Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout,2018 Vintage,4.31
Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout,"Bottles shared at home, thanks Maarten! Jet black colour. Small beige head. Aroma is very heavy on the vanilla, overwhelmingly so, and a bit artificial tbh. Additional sweetness. Retronasal it's very sweet, vanilla a bit more balanced, and bourbon-boozy. Flavour is heavy sweet, chocolate, cocos. Full bodied, oily mouthfeel. Long finish. A bit overwhelming on the vanilla, but still delicious",4.27
Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout,"2018 Release, 14.9% ABV.",4.49
Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout,"9/4/2018 1 pint 9 ounce bottle poured into a DFH tulip. Dark brown body topped by a smallish tan head which dissipated rapidly. Sipped this very slowly and eventually the carbonation completely disappeared and was like a British Barleywine. Smell was very vanilla and barrel forward with other undefined flavors lurking in the background. Taste was just gorgeous as competing vanilla, toffee, barrel and chocolate flavors interacted. Mouthfeel was thick and chewy; just what I needed on a cold early spring evening after I walked the dog (my avatar) in the rain and settled in to listen to music and read. For whatever reason, BCBS enhances my music listening experiences. Just a great barrel aged imperial stout.",4.57
Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout,"Pours pitch black and semi syrupy with minimal head. Massive chocolate and vanilla aroma, very boozy. Flavor is basic BCBS base with fresh Madagascar vanilla bean in its purest form. Carbonation adds to a creamy mouthfeel. Really, really good beer.",4.46
Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout,"Taste: complex, rich, sweet, vanilla, bourbon, boozy, malty, dark fruit, raisins, cocoa, intense warming finish. Same with the nose. Black, opaque, tan head, delicate lace. Full body. 60 IBUs",4.37
Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout,on draft,4.61
Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout,"Dark brown color with a bit of tan foam. Aroma has chocolate, fudge and lots of vanilla beans. Taste is sweet at first with vanilla and fudge, toffee, some bourbon but not very intense, light roasted malt bitterness on the finish. Heavy body with soft carbonation. Really nice flavors with a good balance.",4.65
Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout,"A: Beer pours a dark cola like black color from the bottle with a slight hint that of brown. Head quickly faded away but left a slight ring behind while drinking. Minimal amount of lacing while drinking the beer. Overall, nice but not outstanding example of how I picture a stout to appear. ",4.75
Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout,"Serving: 1 Pt. 0.9 Fl. oz. bottle poured into a GI BCBS snifter. Bottled on 9/6/18, making this just over 6 months old. ",4.71
Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout,"A bit heavy on the vanilla until it warms up a bit, then the roasted notes and bourbon catch up. A flavor adventure that evolves with every taste. I prefer the regular BCS but this is a nice change.",4.37
Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout,"Tasted from 10 year old bottle. Pours black with slight dark brown head. Awesome complex aroma and taste. Nose of bourbon and vanilla. Thick and chewy mouthfeel. No boozy notes at all. Flavors of caramel, molasses, bourbon, cocoa, and nice vanilla but not overpowering. Hands down one of the best beers I’ve ever had.",5
Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout,"2018 vintag tasted in a snifter from draft at Whole Foods Market on December 5, 2018. Brewed with grade A vanilla beans from Madagascar. Notes of aromatic vanilla, marshmallow, toffee, oak, and floral notes highlighting the creamy mouthfeel and enhancing the chocolate flavors of the base beer. Delicious.",4.54
Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout,"The beer pours a nice creamy brown head that dissipates at a moderate pace. The beer itself is a dark chocolate syrup brown with a nice looking creamy texture to it. The smell is pretty good. It has a strong creamy milk chocolate note with a sweet and sugary vanilla note with a tiny bit of bourbon to even things out. The taste is also good with a nice and strong vanilla and bourbon note upfront that is actually a bit sweet while the milk chocolate comes out. There is a tiny bit of vanilla bitterness that you get but it seems to be more of an afterthought. The feeling is good. It has a heavy and creamy body that flows silky through the mouth. Overall, this was a pretty good beer even though the vanilla isn't as good as it could be.",4.48
Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout,Highly suggested to let your bottle warm. Given that the vanilla just doesnt come through right and has that mass produced kind of feel to it. A bit too sweet too. Despite that the mouthfeel is nice but a bit thin as is the smell. Barrel is medium. Decent i was expecting a lot worse given the initial reviews but i would like to revisit this down the road. Its not hot at all.,4.33
Doubleganger,"This was a magical pour. The burnt orange color reminded me of a sunburnt 1967 les paul custom. I poured it into a 16oz Trillium IPA glass, and the resulting finger of foam formed was tantalizing. My eyes glistened as I grabbed the glass and positioned it to my mouth. I took my first sip. The day's stress vanished at the instant this magical nectar touched my lips. Spectacular. The hops took me on a journey through the outer-sphere of taste euphoria where I found love in its purest form. At this moment I realized that everything else in my life is meaningless, except this beer. This beer is incredible. I do not need anything in this world other than this beer.. After I finished my first can, I felt invincible. This stuff is incredible.",4.81
Doubleganger,"16 oz can. Canned 10-2, purchased 10-12, consumed 10-20. Has a typical gorgeous TH look - a glowing hazy orange with a nice head and great lacing. Smells like ripe tropical and citrus fruit. Taste is similar but more restrained than expected. Almost zero bitterness. Mouthfeel is, if anything, too soft. 8.2% abv is completely hidden. Overall, it is delicious but somehow this beer manages to be too mild.",4.34
Doubleganger,"Pours like a golden slurry. Mango, sugar cane, pineapple, and grapefruit on the nose. There's a lot of Dole Pineapple with some zesty grapefruit. It's not as intense as I would have expected having had side by sides of other TH beers. Solid, just not great.",4.22
Doubleganger,Look. fantastic,4.53
Doubleganger,16oz. can into Nightshift stemware. Shared with schen9303. ,4.79
Doubleganger,Definitely a juicebomb. Typical Treehouse rill of slightly oversweetness. Not as bad as things like Sap or Green or Haze. Pretty nice feel. Not boozy too much. PRETTY Balanced. The malt makes spicy like Selma Hyek’s butthole. I’d buy it again probably. Just wouldn't drive all the way to Charlton.,4.18
Doubleganger,"Thanks again to JC for this 16 oz. can. Sadly, most of its friends are already gone, with this soon to follow. ",3.5
Doubleganger,Typical TH pour into the glass - pulpy orange juice haze with a nice initial head holding. Decent lacing on the glass. The first thing that strikes you even upon opening the can is the presence of heavy hops and a sense of wort> I mean that in a good way as it smells like a brewery in the middle of the process. Almost a chewy drink with plenty of deep citrus (mainly orange with some grapefruit) & pine resin notes. Couple those taste notes with some dank and ripe tropical fruits. Feels lush and great in the mouth with an appropriate amount of malty bitterness following through. Super ale.,4.56
Doubleganger,16 oz. can dated 8/28/19. Poured into Ocelot Becher glass.,4.53
Doubleganger,Quick review - on tap at Tree House:,4.58
Doubleganger,"Oh my goodness this was an absolutely incredible IPA. Quite possibly one of the best NE-style IPAs I've ever had - very close to Tree House's Green, and a bit better than Heady Topper. Found this online, can date 7/17/19 so wanted to try it as soon as possible to sample it fresh. Juicy, refreshing, soft, hazy, everything I was looking for in a NE-style IPA - and my expectations were sky-high for this beer, as they are for any Tree House IPA. Looks absolutely incredible - orange-yellow hazy quite opaque color, a little white fluffy head and some nice spotty lingering lacing. More lacing would have bumped up the look rating to 4.75. Smells great, loads of fruity tropical hops - mango, passion fruit, tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit, lemon, maybe a touch of papaya. Definitely tropical and ripe fruit. Also some more balanced malt, vanilla, bread, and then some floral and grassy hop notes at the end. Dankness was muted and well-restrained. Taste follows the nose, again with a good balanced hit of both the bitter hops and sweeter malt backbone. Dankness at the finish was very well-received. The mouthfeel of these world-class NE IPAs is just ridiculous - soft, juicy, slightly sticky, coats the palate, smooth and creamy. Perfect amount of carbonation. The higher ABV was very well hidden and these ones are just so dangerous to drink as the alcohol will creep up on you. I could drink these all days and if they distributed anywhere in this region (Midwest) I'd find them and buy 6-packs galore.",4.68
Doubleganger,"A TH favorite. From a can dated 7/17/19 (straight from can). The tropical flavors of Doppelganger revved up here and make for a delectable DIPA without booziness. On inspection, pours a cloudy. Flavor rich. I think one of the best NEIPAs.",4.75
Doubleganger,"Can (one off) from De Bierkoning. Canned on 17 July, so 13 days ago. Pours a milky/juicy yellow colour, very cloudy, and a small white-ish (almost yellow) head with little retention. Aroma's: very dank with light citrus notes, oats and lactose. Retronasl the citrus is a bit more present, still with lots of dank hops and some sweetness. Flavour is light sweet and moderate bitter, with light fruity sourness. Medium bodied. Faily low carbonation. Light hopburn. Long finish, quite dry and moderate bitter.",4.21
Doubleganger,"One of my favorites from TH. This beer is absolutely delectable. It takes what I love about doppelganger and somehow makes it more tropical. Guava, Grapefruit, Melon, papaya, and jackfruit hit you on the nose and the flavor follows suit. Anytime this beer is made I make a point to get it. It's just so easy to drink for a DIPA",4.81
Doubleganger,1 PINT can,4.25
Doubleganger,"Perfection in a can. Julius led to Alter Ego, which led to Doppelgänger, leading us to Doubleganger which I wish I could get at an unlimited supply. Elevated dry-hopped complexity which is unbelievably balanced. I would drink in gallons if possible. My favorite beer of all time.",5

Doubleganger,"Really excellent beer. First can I had much fresher was better than this can I’m drinking now about 2 months later, fresher can was one of the best beers I’ve ever had, maybe a 5. Incredible creamy mouthfeel, a dank, ripe, tropical, citrus juice bomb. This older can’s mouthfeel is a bit less thick and creamy, a bit more of a rich syrup to it. Dank juicy mango, orange, lemon, peach, a bit of an alcohol heat that wasn’t present in the fresher can. Great beer, worth the hype.",4.75

Heard a lot about this beer and it was not easy to obtain but for some reason, this didn't stand head and shoulders above the better offerings that I've had from Tree House over the years. Full, dank, and full of underlying strength, this was a solid offering that improved greatly as it warmed up, but never did I feel that this was a ""wow"" beer...",4.35
Doubleganger,This beer is awesome. ,4.68
Doubleganger,Can dated 1/18/19. Poured into Belgian tulip.,4.43
Doubleganger,Pouring a cold 16 oz can into my snifter. The beer pours a cloudy goldenrod color with 1.5 cm of dense bleached white head foaming up from an aggressive pour. I get a mix of citrus and pineapple notes on the nose. I also get a bit of a creamsicle note on the nose. The alcohol is well hidden and I dont get a lot of malt character here.,4.54
Fuzzy,Very similar to Smooth. ,4.67
Fuzzy,"Pours a clouded amber to orange color with a fizzy, small head, which immediately diminishes to a small coating.",4.35
Fuzzy,"B3 - I have to say I like how this is not as acidic as the other vintages. I mean sure, it’s tart, definitely, but it’s millions of peaches, peaches for free/me/us! Dug it.",4.4
Fuzzy,Tasted from bottle. Blend #2. Pours a hazy gold with white head. Big sour funk aroma of lacto with peaches. Taste is very sour. Flavors of peaches with lactobacillus. Very nice peach flavor with a lot of pucker.,4.33
Fuzzy,good peach sour. long finish. ren's bottle. spider lace. not overwhelming sour. very fruity. a delight. great balancing.  A bit of orange fruit colour.,4.04
Fuzzy,"Everything's just peachy at the Side Project brewhouse when the brewery takes their Missouri raised fruit and embellishes a Brussels' styled sour ale. Aided with chardonnay barrels, the character of this sour ale simply keeps building.",4.31
Fuzzy,"Truly one of the best sours out there. Hard to get your hands on but worth the price. Unfortunately, when you get a pour or bottle it does not last long. I had this at Side Project bar in early 2017, visiting a friend in St. Louis. I believe it was the second batch, good haze with a bright orange. Had a sweet complexity of peaches that developed into everlasting funky, earthy, acidity that beckoned another sip. Must try if you are a sour lover.",5
Fuzzy,"B1 Starbright, mid-high clarity, champagne effervescence, appropriate head and retention per style, straw-green hue; errupting notes of underipe apricot and peach, lemon zest, lemon juice, flesh, damp slate, damp grass, damp barnyard bedding; under and over ripe peach, apricot, peach pit sweat, lemon rind and juice; pleasant and thin feel with appropriate effervescence, residual and cloying acid and sugars; ",4.65
Fuzzy,"On tap at Beavertown Extravaganza. Aroma is funky and floral with unripe peach and apricot and hay notes. Taste is tart, fruity and lactic with some fruit pit bitterness.",4.3
Fuzzy,"Had this at the Firestone Walker 2017 Invitational. The long line paired well with the hangover I was nursing in the heat. Pours innocent and yellow with a chunkee or two floating around and a super thin mild head that was gone before I took a sip. Wow, what a great aroma. Peach, brett, barrel, funky yet dry. Pretty top notch in that department. ",4.24
Fuzzy,"What an excellent beer. Amazing nuance and waves of flavor. Perfect fruit balance. Very well done. Best beer at Shelton Bros ""The Festival"" 2017 IMHO.",4.92
Fuzzy,"Had a 4oz pour at a bottleshare. Look wasn't anything crazy but the smell was so complex showcasing barrel,funk, and loads of peaches in perfect balance. The taste was both jammy and some dryness in the back. The feel was medium and effervescent. Overall a great BA fruited wild ale that i hope i can get my own bottle to share with the wife.",4.72
Fuzzy,Shared a 375 from the most recent batch with my brother. This was my first beer from side project and I think he gave away a little much for it. I like this beer overall and was very drinkable. I thought while tart and sour it wasn't over the top like some are saying. At the same time it wasn't very bold. I could have crushed the whole bottle to myself easily but in the same vain of IPAs I'm not really a session guy. Just expected something more.,3.93
Fuzzy,Batch 2 375ml bottle,4.76
Fuzzy,I had been wanting to try this one for a long time and it did not disappoint. Perfectly carbonated with just the right amount of sourness and so drinkable at 8%. Just wonderful.,4.75
Fuzzy,Bottle poured into fluted snifter.,4.6
Fuzzy,"Pale and transparent straw color. Creamy lacing with great retention and glass sticking. Awesome peach and acid aroma with mild wood. Initial burst of tartness on the palate, vinegar and lightly citric. White peaches midway: sweet, light, dry and perfectly integrated with the delicate malt. Subtle oak and funk with underlying white grapes. No way to tell this is 8%. So subtle and well blended it tastes like 5%. Light and creamy feel, perfect carbonation, dry finish. Subtlety and balance are hallmarks of this gem. As close to perfection as any beer can achieve.",4.93
Fuzzy,"Pours a clear straw color with a finger of white head even on a small 5oz pour. Head foams up quick with large bubbles, and yet despite this retains well. Aroma gives off notes of apricot and yeast with little else to distract. Flavor profile is the same with an addition of grape. The flavor profiles packs a light tartness that mingles on the edge of sour. It's nothing crazy wild in terms of sour, but just enough to add another dimension to the flavor profile. Mouth feel is fizzy and fuzzy with a medium-thin thickness. Overall, this beer is flavorful. It drinks more like a champagne then anything else. ",4.71
Fuzzy,"Pours a clear peach color in the glass with no head. Smell is fresh peaches. This beer has aged a bit, but the peaches are still bursting out of the glass. Sour peach candy, wet hay, bread cracker, oak, subtle band aid. The taste is mouth puckering tart and bursting with peach skin and juicy peach flesh, green apple, white wine, and some lemon. Oak and subtle funk add complexity. I've never had this fresh, but it would seem this is developing some nice complexity in the bottle. Mouth feel is sturdy and on point. Carb is rich and full bodied. Nice acetic vinegar notes add strength to the flavor and edge to the mouth feel. Excellent.",4.68
Fuzzy,"The best American sour I have ever had. This is on par with Cantillon for the funk and sourness. This beer was super sour and tart, but so drinkable. Loved it.",5
Fuzzy,"Unfortunately, it's sort of one-note. It tastes like a sour, unripe peach. That's it. I wanted the Side Project funk, and it's just not there. It's just flat out warhead sour. Good, but I am wanting more.",4.06
Fuzzy,"Gold in color with a light cloudiness and a fingernail of dishwater white. I smell peach, pear, and green apples. The taste is a delictable lightly tart green apples, pear, peach, and tart Brettanomyces. The mouth is bone dry and moderately carbonated.",4.38

Double Citra®,"12oz can purchased at the brewery. Pours a hazy dirty orange with an inch of head. Moderate amount of lacing. Lots of citra hops in the nose.

Some alcohol heat. Medium body with a dry mouthfeel.",4.27
Double Citra®,"Orange juice color with a light tan head topping it off, this beer glides down your glass and clings like Velcro. Wow, what a sight to see.",4.52
Double Citra®,Oh my.,5
Double Citra®,"More orange than golden pour, creamy bright white head, and the smell! Pop the top and it's like someone in the room just sliced a grapefruit. We know we're dealing with a single hop beer, and the taste, while consistent and one note, still takes you on a journey. The Citra comes through loud and clear, and then at a point in the midtaste, that taste kind of ramps up to a new level. And let's not forget that long, luxurious aftertaste. Brilliantly crafted.",4.5
Double Citra®,"Double Citra pours a milky and creamy orange color with a complex white cap on top that lingers leaving some impressive lacing. The smell is a true NE style DIPA, big and juicy on the nose with layer upon layer of Citra hops bringing out the citrus and tropical fruits including mango, grapefruit, peach and a hint of melon with some earthy tones and an herb quality. The taste, this is closest I've come to a perfect beer. Wow! This Double Citra tastes amazing, very soft and smooth over the palette with a light body that brings out orange, tangerine, grapefruit and some melon sweetness with a subdued bitterness.",4.59
Double Citra®,"Pours an opaque orange with two fingers of frothy, dense white foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is a blast of tangerine, papaya, lemon and mandarin oranges. Grassy hops and a light bready yeast at the back rounds out the aroma. Flavor profile is tangerine, papaya, mango, lemon, mandarin oranges, and bready malts create a soothing hypnotic experience. Balance is sublime, never coming off overly sweet or bitter. Mouth feel has a consistent siltiness to it with a medium-thick consistency that adds power to each sip. Overall, a delectable brew with big tropical fruit notes, and a well-refined balance. ",4.71

The smell is full of rich hops, juicy citrus, especially lemon and grapefruit, floral, herbal, and savory notes. It pours a beautiful haze with a finger of foam, that laces beautifully down the glass. Feels rich and full in the body. Taste is impressive, with citra driving the rest of the many supporting flavors. Wow",4.65

Taste is moderately bitter with a nice malt backbone. A little more bitterness on this then some of the other Hill Farmstead IPAs as well as not as creamy a mouthfeel as some.

Double Citra®,"Got in a BIF from Roguer. 750 ml swing top growler into signature tulip glass, best before 3/25/2017. Pours very hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Awesome webby soapy lacing clings around the glass. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of huge tangerine, orange juice, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berries, lemon/orange zest, light pine, honey, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/fruity hops and moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, orange juice, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berries, lemon/orange zest, light pine, honey, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light pine/grassy/citrus peel bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, orange juice, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berries, lemon/orange peel, light pine, honey, bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/fruity hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a fantastic malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Slight dryness from lingering bitterness, lightly increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready, and lightly silky/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is fantastic. Slight resin/rinds near the end of the glass. Zero warming alcohol for 8%. Overall this is a world class DIPA! All around insane complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/fruity hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV, thanks to the smooth/mellow bitterness. Super dank, juicy, and vibrant on hop flavors; great malt balance without feeling sweet or heavy for the ABV. An absolutely mind blowing offering.",4.6

Ann,"Glad to cross this one off the bucket list. Shared at HF. Golden pour, baby finger sized white head, no lacing. Aroma of green grape, white wine, oak, apricot, white peach.

Ann,"2014 Vintage from the taproom. Finally got to have the beer I have most coveted since I started visiting the enchanted beer mecca in 2013 and have proceeded to make the trek once a month since. All the trips finally paid off as it was there for on-site consumption. Had side by side with Le Sarrasin and Being and Time which might have thrown off the overall ranking. This was smooth as silk, fluffy clouds, extremely pleasant with where the base honey beer accentuated the wine barrel. The smell wasn't over powering, or super aromatic to me. A little bit of funk, don't know if that had to do with it being a 14. Once again the feel was the crazy thing to me and defintley stood out. It was super drinkable and if this was a beer I could have on a regular basis to have with dinner it would be amazing. I have to say that there was something tin the way Le Sarrasin finished that I like it better. This was a joy to try and hopefully will run into again. $33 for a 375 to the dome is worth it all day.",4.49
Ann,"The 2014 vintage, poured on-site at the Hill Farmstead taproom. ",4.65

Ann,"Had it onsite at the brewery yesterday. Tons of honey in the smell but not much on the tongue, lots of white wine type flavors. Great beer but probably not one of my top favorites.",4.75
Ann,"From a bomber. Pours golden. Smells tart, citrusy, only hinting at funk. Taste is exceptional: tart opening, laced with hints of honey, moves into perfectly balanced funkiness. The most nuanced wild saison, and just one of the top 5 or so beers, I've ever had. I live far enough from the brewery that a visit would require an overnight stay in the area, but this one made me start thinking of how to take that trip.",4.79
Ann,Hill Farmsteads finest! Amazing BA Saison that is smooth with a nice barrel finish. Purchased this bottle along with many others of its caliber for a small group tasting and it was definitely one of the stars!,5

Ann,"Bottle at the brewery on 3/10. Delicate fermentation, honey from base beer is all but gone. Nice, mellow tartness, lots of barrel characteristic. Funky finish. Very good, but I don't think it quite deserves the hype, nor value it gets.",4.71

Ann,"One of my all-time wants. Glad to finally try -- thanks James. Had back to back with Anna and you could really see the refinement. This is the sophisticated big sister with all the sharp edges smoothed off. Lovely, vinous and soft. This is definitely worthy of its top tier status. I would likely go with Sarrasin as the best HF saison, but this is right there. Phenomenal beer.",4.75
Ann,"A - Hazy medium orange color, thick creamy white ring.",4.46
Ann,"This poured out as a nice hazed golden color with a thin white head. The smell of the beer is really nice, good amount of Yeast and wine barrel aroma, subtle funk, with melon and citrus in there too. The taste is very nice also, plenty of tart lemony flavors there is a honey sweetness in there blended with the funk. Overall another outstanding saison from Hill Farmstead.",4.64
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,Poured from a bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip. 2017 edition,4.74
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Pours black with a finger of caramel-colored foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is roasty and dark, with cinnamon, nutmeg, chocolate, cocoa nibs, toffee and molasses creating the bulk of the nose. Roasty and toasty malts are supportive and abundant. Flavor profile is huge, hitting notes of cinnamon, cardoman, nutmeg, molasses, toffee, caramel, dark fruits, coffee, chocolate and cocoa nibs. Big sugary notes, but they are balanced out by roasty and toasty malts. Mouth feel is thick and full, with a modest level of graininess. Overall, deep and expressive with loads of flavor. Lovely stout!",4.63
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Slightly overrated IMO. This stout is on the high end of the cinnamon war, so if that's your thing - you must try it. No too sweet, I'll give it that. Otherwise I've found many more balanced brews in the category, such as Coffee Cinnamon Bourbon Abominable by Fremont. Hunahpu is worthy of a try and of forming your own opinion, but you may also not find it up to the hype.",4.35

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"I finally got to try this whale after a trade. I thought it was similar to Abraxas. I had a 2017, and may have bunkered it too long with the flavors becoming much more mild than other reviewers indicate. ",4.27
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,I finally landed this whale. I have wanted to drink this beer for the last five years. I am looking forward to this review. I popped the top off and a hiss emitted. The beer is 52 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The beer just glugged out of the bottle as I poured it into the glass. This thick beer produced a two finger dark brown head. The retention on the head is phenomenal. The head dissipated slowly and left no lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 38 nearly black. The beer is opaque. ,4.87
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Fascinating and very complex beer! The chilis come through, but are not overpowering. This is a sipping beer, and I'm glad I had a small pour at the brewery. Great stuff--I've been to Cigar City a number of times, but this is the first time I've seen Hunahpu's on tap. Hooray!",4.49
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,Very pretty looking. Pitch brown in all the right ways. Love the little lacing patches that linger after each drink. Lots of cinnamon on the nose to go with dark almost leathery chocolate. Mexican heat heat too - brightens up the same notes from the nose and adds some notes of chiles.,4.37

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Dark, thick beer with darkest, thickest head I've ever seen. Aromas include coffee, chocolate, molasses, dark malt and done fruitiness which is reminiscent of raspberries or cherries. The taste is all that but amplified. There is cinnamon in the flavor I did not detect in aroma. This is a thick, chewy, decadent beer. Really amazing.",4.78

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"22oz bottle at share. What a way to wash that previous stout out of my mouth. This is was truly excellent all the way around. Silky black pour with small ring of beige head.

Thought this would be the evening's winner, but there was a better one out there....",4.41

King Sue,"As someone who lives near Treehouse, I have had a lot of it. This is every bit as good as a Julius in my opinion, maybe better.

Complex....I like this beer a lot....and folks continue to dri k beer and support you local brewery. HOG.",4.74
King Sue,"Pint can packaged 2019-08-28. Pours a cheery orange, opaque and cloudy with a full finger of head. Pleasant green mango and citrus on the nose. Some fruit carries through to the palate, but predominantly a lot of hop burn and some pepper--not at all what I expected, given that I saw no sedimentation goop when rinsing out the pint can for recycling. In any case, this is coming across a hit hamfisted and very over the top, rather than balanced.",3.72

King Sue,Can Date: 7/17/19,4.36
King Sue,"I don't get all wacky with long winded reviews. I enjoy beer enough to travel to Belgium where the best beer in the world is brewed. Poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Loved the hazy appearance. Good nose of citrus. King Sue is a excellent citrus type IPA. Very, very refreshing without being a simple IPA. Not bitter which is what simpletons like.",4.77
King Sue,"Growler into pint glass. Pours a very hazy burnt amber with an off-white, persistent head. Initial impression is a very balanced, mildly bitter brew - citrus notes but certainly not a juice bomb. The appearance would lead you to expect a pillowy NEIPA, but that's not the case. Mouthfeel is lighter than I would expect for a 7.8% beer, but then King Sue seems to delight in thwarting unfounded assumptions. Finish is smooth and slightly bitter.",4.09
King Sue,"The emphasis in the beer is a strong, sharp, hoppy finish with citrus highlights. It’s a throwback to the brewing style emphasizing a hoppy edge overshadowing a citrus profile. Newer approaches to a DIPA have more balanced citrus flavors with a more subdued hoppy finish. Excellent beer.",4.04
King Sue,Very subdued beer for the %. Flavor notes come across subtly which I like. Tastes super smooth and has a very clean after taste. I pick up on the mango and orange after I swallow the beer. Grew on me. Not super impressive at first but it is an excellent beer.,4.6
King Sue,"Date: Canned on 08/19/19, enjoyed on 09/09/19.",4.49
King Sue,"Bright look. Lots of floaties. Great tasting ipa. Smells of citrus. Orange, grapefruit. Tastes very...juicy. I think I tasted a bit of honey even. Really enjoyed this one.",4.76
King Sue,"Canned 8/19/19. The tropical fruit notes of pineapple and mango are nice but there is a lingering, abrasive, caramel sweetness that needs blunted by more bitterness. Good stuff, but I'll be on the look out for fresh Pseudo over this one.",4.14
King Sue,"Appearance: Pours a completely hazy, pale lemon color with a glowing white head. SRM of 5.5. (3.75)",4.42
King Sue,"Pretty good in the stupid NE IPA style at least we don't call call this an APA like Pseudo Sue ... oh my, sometimes the categorization and or reviews around here ... ",4.06
King Sue,Pours a think and hazy golden color with a 1 finger head. All citrus and melon on the nose. You can taste the Citra hops with some tropical fruit blended in. Smooth and creamy finish with a heavy body and almost no alcohol present. I’ve heard before that there is a bitter aftertaste but did not seem that way for me. Overall excellent NEIPA glad I was able to find some locally.,4.82
King Sue,"I had a tallboy can of this recently thanks to a friend's generosity after his road trip to St. Louis. It is a very tasty NEIPA. I found it to be very fruity, but I experienced a little alcohol burn in the end. In other words, it's a little on the boozy side for me.",4.18

Atrial Rubicite,"It took a lot to get one of these so I was anxious when I popped the top. I was happy to be greeted by a a funky raspberry aroma. From the smell, I thought it would be sweet, but it was pleasantly dry. What a great beer! My only regret was that I drank it too fast- so damn tasty. A trip to Austin is in order.",4.87
Atrial Rubicite,"Beautiful deep read with a minimal Ruby lacing around the circumference of the glass. Nose is pure Raspberry and some the jester King culture, very dry. The nose made me concerned that if was going to be pure acid. Suprised that it was a dry raspberry flavor with a subtleness of wild microflora. Feel is initially effervescent on the tounge and then quickly dissipates. Overall excellent, think it can slightly more carbed",4.45
Atrial Rubicite,L: Deep Ruby in Color. Thin pink head that dissipates quickly,4.51

Atrial Rubicite,"Batch 8 (June 2018), poured into a JK SPON tulip. The look is amazing; deep ruby, almost mistakable for a Bordeaux. Moderate carbonation that dissipates very quickly. The nose is full of jammy raspberry and signature JK funk; moderately musty, dusty, and woody. Palate is mildly tart and acetic, with plenty of jammy raspberry, oak, and some yogurt (especially on the finish); getting close to a fruited lambic in style. Very enjoyable.",4.49
Atrial Rubicite,"Batch 8 poured in Casey teku. Pours a bright vibrant clear ruby red with a soft whispy pink head. Nose has that mellow Greek yogurt smell going on with a blast of tart and sweet raspberries and cherries. First sip is a little of everything. Tart, mellow funk, musty, jammy! I love the depth and intensity of the raspberries. It’s definitely jam like, perfect tart to sweet ratio as far as the berries go. Nice mellow wet oak throughout that really ties it together. Musty cellar like quality and mild yogurt funk all come together to make this beer what it is. As it warms the raspberries shine even more and tartness builds but this beer is equally interesting on both the colder and warmer side. Body is medium to Jammy at times. Tart funky dry finish at the end that invites another swig to wet the mouth and start the process all over again.",4.53
Atrial Rubicite,"What's not to like here? Pours a burgundy with a finger of pink head. Smell is fresh, sweet yet slightly tart raspberry. A hint of oak.",4.81

And then, suddenly, I had TWO trades go through within a week of each other! Exciting.",4.91
Atrial Rubicite,"On tap at Hops and Pie. Extremely purple with a pink head, vibrant colors. Smells like a jar of raspberry preserves, very jammy and fruity. Sweetness as well. Flavor was mostly raspberry preserves and a slight sourness. I understand now why people might seek out Jester King.",4.29
Atrial Rubicite,Poured from a mini bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip. Love the artwork,4.58
Atrial Rubicite,"2015 bottle (Blend 5) - deep lipstick red with a thin white/redish head that quickly goes away. Smell is heavy raspberry with a little funk. Was somewhat let down by the lack of farmhouse funk smell. Flavor follows. Overall a superb beer, just may have aged a touch too long. At nearly three years old, I think this maybe aged 4-6 mnoths too long.",4.81
Atrial Rubicite,"Batch from June of 2017. Pours a dark rich red/purple with some carbonation. Smell is sweet pungent raspberry and earthy. Taste is tart, very refreshing, unabashedly raspberry. Dances the line between a fruity juice and a sour beer. Smooth and easy to drink. Really enjoyed it.",4.52
Atrial Rubicite,"Appearance was darker than expected but everything else was just as advertised. It has plenty of raspberry flavor, but its more than a juice bomb. Subtle funk, dryness, and raspberry seeds make it a very enjoyable treat.",4.34

Atrial Rubicite,"Look: dark red with a gorgeous 1inch purple red head, dissipated quick ",4.65
Atrial Rubicite,"Sour punch nose - very well done, balancing fruit and sour elements. The raspberry underpinnings mingle well with the brew and the beer stays very clean. Not too much of anything.",4.54
Atrial Rubicite,Generously shared by my younger brother. Beautiful pour. Utterly stunned with the color. Dense just beautiful color. Awesome raspberry smell really fruity. Taste leaves a little bit more to be desired. I thought this would carry the fruit better like a degarde would but it has a lot of what I would call a hybrid between a fruited Belgian kriek and an American wild. It's really nice I just was hoping for more pop. Nice sour mouthfeel not too tart.,4.37
Atrial Rubicite,"This review is for the 2017 July 21 release of Atrial Rubicite, ABV 5.20%. First a note, I was told by Jester King staff on July 15 that Atrial Rubicite would most likely be released in October (2017), and then they released it the next weekend. I had no way of finding out it would be released the weekend after and I don’t live in Austin (Dallas). This was annoying and complicated things for me, but I was able to make it and I was able to enjoy a couple of 8oz Atrial Rubicite at Jester King, and I also bought three 500ml bottles. The lines were a bit intimidating. It shouldn’t have to be this difficult, but in the end it was worth the trouble. This is a rare and extremely good raspberry sour (ABV 5.20% this year). I suffered for it but I love it.",4.97

My takeaway from Hill Farmstead IPA's after not having them for three years is that they are more refined and subtle than some of the stuff from Treehouse or Trillium.

Granted I am far from a sour expert and not very good at describing beers like this, but this one is excellent. Pours a nice ruby-brown. The aroma and flavor are finely layered, complex, ebbing and flowing. A yin and yang of huge barny funk complete with gloves, dirt, tack room, muddy, bruised medicinal herbs, etc. balanced with an equally assertive sour cherry, red-wine tanninic, oaky, funky medley with macerated berry bushes (dirt, roots, leaves and all). It is very drinkable for as tart as it is (for my tastes at least) and has the subtle, near-constant, tongue-corner-mouth-watering-tickle-thing going on that makes beers like this a non-stop experience when drinking them, as its residue lingers and evolves in your mouth between sips. Very nice! (4.75)",4.52
Supplication,"
The cherries add a nice tardiness too.",4.4
Supplication,"375ml bottle, that was bottled on '012518'. ABV% is labeled as 7.75%.",4.56
Supplication,"July 27th, 2015 - Finally, the last Russian River taster on this long journey through the absolute unit of a taster tray served to our table. The Supplication is a relaxed auburn color, and the aroma is a bright cherry note, and I instantly fall in love. The flavor introduces vanilla, sherry and cherry with a delicious tartness, and an excellent freshness. The oak is well balanced too, making this is an excellent finish to our day marking the completion of our beer pilgrimage.",4.34
Supplication,"I received this from @bum4ever in the NBS BIF 8.5. Bottled on 7/2/2018 and poured from a 375 ML cork and cage bottle into a tulip glass. The color is somewhere between ruby and orange and the ecru-colored head dissipated quickly. It has a very fragrant smell of ripe cherry, oak, red wine, and brett yeast. The taste is complex: tart cherry, pinot noir, oak, and a crackery malt at the finish. The flavors are all bold but they blend very well and there is a surprising balance of sweet and sour. It finishes with a touch of bitterness. This ale is a nice, full body with lively carbonation, and it's easily drinkable at 7.75% ABV. While I am not a connoisseur of Wild Ales, I have to say that Supplication is really delicious and fun to drink.",4.49
Supplication,"Pours a reddish brown color with a thin foamy head. No head retention with mild to moderate lacing. Tart, smooth taste with cherries and mild red wine. Nice tart taste with cherries up front and red wine on the end. Smooth. Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation.",4.26
Supplication,"Pours a reddish-brownish orange with fine, soft head.",4.02
Supplication,Pours a beautiful slightly hazy deep reddish amber color with a 2 finger biscuit head. Aroma is dense with red whine and oak notes. Flavor is warm oak up front quickly turning to pinot noir notes. A rich sweet malt behind it blended with the lightly sour notes is very well done. Feel is lightly soft with a moderate effervescence. This is just stupendous. Perfectly balances in all regards.,4.7
Supplication,"It smells phenomenal. I don’t think the taste lives up to the smell, and for the price and hype I have to say I was disappointed. ",4.11
Supplication,Pours deep reddish brown. Lovely head but short lived.,4.75
Supplication,2017 vintage. Rating #400 for me on BA.,4.42
Supplication,Pours a dark reddish brown with a quickly receding off white head. Nose is tart sour cherry. Taste follows with a definite red wine influence. Definitely the 2nd best wild ale I've tasted next to RR Consecration.,4.43

Supplication,"Pours a deep ruby brown color, minimal foam head. Cherry / raspberry aroma. Tart and slightly sweet, ample sour cherry flavor, light oak on the dry finish. Overall very enjoyable. ",4.38
Supplication,"375 mL bottle into a wine since no tulip glass was available. The beer pours a light copper color with amber tint. Opacity is hazy, partially due to the chill, and partially due to a poor pour on my part – I likely stirred up the layer of spent-yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle during my far-too-vigorous pour. Carbonation is light in density, but heavy in quantity. 1-inch head dissipates very quickly, giving way to very lively bubbles in the center of the glass that persist throughout the tasting. First smell yields obvious fermented fruits; among them cherry, raspberry, and perhaps a bit of wild plum. Upon taking my first sip, I let the liquid wash over the entirety of my tongue to feel the light pricks of carbonation. The drying sourness is quite powerful. The flavor is similar to the nose, beginning with tart cherries leading to a warming sensation that blends well with a touch oak at the back of the tongue. As the flavor develops, I detect a slight malty sweetness that I didn’t notice on the nose. The oak and malt slowly mature into an earthy effervescence in the back of the mouth. This flavor is ephemeral, but the bubbly sensation continues to play at my tongue even long after the swallow.",4.45
Supplication,Bottled 2/27/17. Pours a clear brownish-red with a light tan head that sticks around. Spotty lace.,4.44
Supplication,"Pours somewhat brownish red in appearance, to be honest not entirely pleasing to the eye.",4.24
Supplication,One of the greats. The beer that will give you a taste for sours. Malty Belgian style sour with cherry notes. MMMMHH MMMH MMH. DELICIOUS. Always a must at any beer fest in the west.,5
Cable Car,"2018 vintage, drank 8/1/2019. Pours orange with a bit of suspended matter. Tons of funk to the nose and taste. Quite sour and acetic. I for some reason had been expecting a kriek - but this is quite good all the same. I'd love to try an aged bottle.",4.5
Cable Car,Bomber from tornado lightly chilled,4.48
Cable Car,"Poured into a tulip glass. Avery clear golden color with a medium white head. Aroma was as white wine, lemon, and stone fruit. The taste followed with a tart cherry flavor and floral notes. A clean dry backbone. Overall a fantastic beer.",4.49
Cable Car,"At last, I got to try this one. The hallmark of this one is the complexity. There are layers upon layers of sour fruit, wood, mineral earthiness, dank funk, and acidic fruits. The smell is a fruity horse blanket, with plenty of musk and funk to go around. Carbonation is a little high, but otherwise wonderful in the feel. A well made beer that stands the test of time",4.39
Cable Car,"05/2016 - 2014 vintage - No effs given about the price for on-site consumption as this beer is truly complex, multi-layered, and beautiful. Semi-sweet, oak, funky, nice tartness; balanced.",4.65

Cable Car,"2016 vintage. Had on draft at Lost Abbey 10th Anniversary party, May 21, 2016. Writing review on notes I took that day.",5
Cable Car,"Right in line with some of the best sours out there. Great taste and feel, but didn't get an outstanding smell from it. Nothing bad, just didn't blow my socks off. Overall, very glad to have tried this one out.",4.45
Cable Car,"This is worth all of the hype. I bought a vintage 2008 bottle about a month ago when I was at Toronado in SF, and I was not disappointed. For an 8 year old beer, this was incredible complex.",4.75
Cable Car,"What a great surprise to get to try this at Toronado during Duck Days of Summer. 2016 Vintage. Poured into a goblet, it is a beautiful golden/orange color with a slight haze, and 1 finger of head. Smells was most stone fruit, peaches, apricots, a bit of lemon. Big creamy body with the right amount of dryness, acidity (mild), and tart & funk. I know they price point turns some folks off, but I considered this a treat and a beer I'd probably never have again so $60 seemed well worth it to me. If I do get another chance to drink this again, I won't hesitate.",4.77
Cable Car,"Not a big sour person, but there beer was very enjoyable. Great hazy orange color and look. Flavor was smooth with more funk than sour for me. Could actually enjoy this very often. 2016 vintage",4.37
Cable Car,"Slightly overrated (especially for what it costs!), but it's still a fantastic beer. I actually found Duck Duck Gooze to be vastly superior to this one.",4.31
Cable Car,Poured from the bottle at Toronado in San Diego on 5/26/16. 2009 release. ,5
Cable Car,"Had this 2014 version. This beer tasted great, I'd still take duck duck over it, but man what a great beer. Great funk, great smell, great taste. I'd gladly drink this one over and over again",5
Cable Car,"I've only had 2012 CC, but it was the best BA AWA I've had....absolutely extraordinary stuff...so complex and amazing. Layers of fruit and funk, but neither was overpowering.",4.91
Cable Car,"Had at Toronado (SF) yesterday, served at perfect temperature. ",4.55
Cable Car,"Mild orange color, solid 1"" of white head on it. Aroma was tart lemons, funk, astringent oak. ",4.6
Cable Car,A very nice sour but count me in the camp of rarity builds some hype in this one. Plenty of other comprable sours at a far lower price point that are easier to acquire.,4.14

Citra,"
B+ (3.84) / VERY GOOD",3.84
Citra,Had on tap at KRBC. Unremarkable head at beginning...but stunning rich amber honey color... and outstanding lacing. Full hop aroma and a citrus bomb for flavor. So clean and drinkable. Reamarkabke easy for an 8% DIPA. Definitely built in the malts perfectly. Yep... lived up to the hype.,4.42
Citra,"Having on draft in a pint glass. Dark amber color with a slight haze and one finger head. Smells of burnt caramel and toasted orange rind. Totally full bodied with creamy carbonation texture. Flavors of roasted pineapple, peach with toasted orange rind bitterness. Long lasting fruit sweetness and bitterness.",4.25
Citra,L: Pours a beautiful golden color. 2 fingers of foamy head with good retention.,4.59
Citra,"Best IPA I've ever had. I waited years to finally get a case of Citra and the wait was worth it. Scary drive to the brewery to pick up the case, but it was a fantastic trip. Numerous great beers but Citra stood out. Actually, they had ""Hazy Citra"" on tap and it was wonderful. If you get a chance to try it, don't pass it up.",4.81
Citra,Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a Teku goblet.,4.81
Citra,A: bright glowing orange. Slight haze. Thick eggshell white bubbles,4.23
Citra,I traveled 2 hours to grab a case of this after I learned about it from a friend. I had to make an advanced purchase online to be eligible for picking it up directly from KRBC. While there I grabbed a couple of pints from the tap. ,4.93
Citra,My local dealer hooked me up with this one. I am no stranger to whales but i honestly had never heard of this brew before my buddy mentioned it.,4.63
Citra,"This was such a highly rated beer, with a previous lottery system, and I was excited to have finally gotten it. I liked it but was a bit disappointed. Look was dark and clear. Smell was pretty weak in comparison to the other strong citra-dominant beers that are out there now. The taste was a lot more balanced between the citra tropical juiciness and the sharper piney bitterness. Was expecting the citra to be more prominent. Mouthfeel was like any other regular IPA. Not bad, but not good. Overall, it was a good beer, but did not live up to my expectations, especially since there are so many newly-popular hazy citra bombs out there now. Worth having, but won't make the tough effort to have again.",3.99
Citra,Look: golden yellow light white head about .5 inches ,4.39
Citra,"Pours a light orange color with a soapy head. Aroma is dank and tropical, with herb and fruity scents.",4.21
Citra,"Juicier than west coast IPAs traditionally tend to be. Brings the malt backbone that is characteristic of West Coast IPAs, imparting additional caramel sweetness. Overall very solid, but for me at least, I prefer the newer trend of hazy, juicy IPAs coming out of places in New England, from Tired Hands, and, for example, from Monkish on the left coast.",3.75
Citra,"While this is a great example of a good west-coast double IPA, I don't know that I agree with the consensus so far in that it's top 50 worthy. The flavor was solid, but nothing over the top like some others, and the mouthfeel was pretty standard for a high quality IPA. Glad I tried it, but won't be rushing out to get it again.",4.18
Citra,"This is a very well made beer, but from talking with friends, the citrus profile falls off quickly. Well balanced with a small amount of citrus, but dominated by the dank/bittering hops.",4.09
Citra,22 oz. bottle poured into a Founders snifter. Bottled on date on the case 11/11/16.,4.5

Citra,Excellent DIPA.,4.35
Focal Banger,"Very, very good. I've never rated Heady Topper because it's been a long time since I've had it. This is almost as good as any beer I've had, though. A little bite to it. There are some I still like better.",4.4
Focal Banger,"I do enjoy this beer, even though some may say I am anti-focal....sorry but to me its not Heady, that isn't saying I don't like it, but if both are on the shelf, I reach for the one and only....",4.42

Focal Banger,"I tried a can of this beer at the Hilton hotel in downtown Burlington,VT. It poured a hazy yellow with white head that left some lace. The scent had tropical fruit notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with tropical fruit peel presence. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall its a solid beer.",4.41
Focal Banger,Look: Light amber with a small white head and minimal lacing.,3.04
Focal Banger,"Expected way more out of this one. I forgot to check the date on the can so maybe I just need to try it fresh. Still a nice highly drinkable IPA, just not up to the hype. Will try again when the situation arises.",4.08

Focal Banger,Can from brewery,4.67
Focal Banger,"One of my favorite DIPAs if not my favorite of the moment. It gets a knock down for look bc it’s just damn ugly. Usually there’s something floating in it, but not this time for me. I smell some bitterness, but of course it doesn’t approach a Westcoast IPA level of it. Still, it’s the perfect balance for me vs some terribly sweet juicy NEIPAs. Don’t ever miss this when you can get it. It slightly outpaces Heady for me.",4.69
Focal Banger,"Can from the brewery in Stowe, VT. Pours a golden orange with a nice touch of opacity, has a fluffy white head with excellent lacing, smell is deep overripe nectarine flesh with a nice spicy grass note and sweet zesty citrus, I also get this like wet mashed potatoes and green onions sort of vibe that I enjoy, taste is a flash of sweet malty goodness up front that is blasted away by a mountain of citrusy hops finished with a nice lingering bitter pith, another odd note I get from this beer at times is French fries dipped in a chocolate milkshake, likely from the sweetness being blasted by sharp hops being similar to the saltiness of a fry juxtaposed to the sweetness of the shake, it’s a weird one. This beer is medium bodied, sharp, and well carbonated. Quite scrummy and it was nice to take a look at it in a glass and get a good whiff, but the taste and mouth feel is far superior from the can. Yum.",4.27
Focal Banger,Damn this beer is just about perfect....even when poured and stored from the stemmed glass. it seduces you with that golden hop glow and aroma of the hop yeild gods of yore. You'll want to drink this with closefriends who can fully appreciate the zenith mood you'll find yourself slipping into.,4.91
Focal Banger,"Poured from can to tulip, hazy yellow, white head, moderate lacing. Nose is fruity, bready, mango, funk. Taste is more piney, grassy, and bitter, some mild fruit and mineral notes. Medium body and carbonation.",4.43
Focal Banger,"Years ago I hated Citra and Mosaic hop combos i remember thinking, why? This beer is so fucking good, had my first 4 for $21 (great Levittown PA bar, thanks to the owner for holding it for me, I got the last 4). You know it's that good when you have to get 3 more elsewhere at $8 a pop, which is a little (alot) ridiculous but look at it this way, its still less than most bar tabs. ",4.82
Focal Banger,"Hop profile is definitely more earthy / grassy, has some vague pepper / vegetal notes as well, beyond that there is some citrus hops but just not in my wheelhouse, too much mosaic for me",3.93
Focal Banger,"A cut above. Drinking straight from the can as God intended. Really nice dank citrus nose, so unbelievably smooth and balanced, perfect dance between dank piney hops and lemon/orange zest, pear, apple cider, apple cider vinegar, so crushable at 7%. An elite IPA.",4.64
Focal Banger,"Cloudy, gold, with two fingers of thick white foam atop. Beautiful look.",4.49
Focal Banger,"A very solid, fine-tasting NE-style IPA but just couldn't hold its own against the more-lauded Heady Topper. I would have loved to know how fresh this beer was since it was so hard to get - but I just couldn't find the canning date anywhere. Pours a very nice, slightly hazy yellow color with abundant fluffy white head and sheets of lingering lacing. Looks very, very nice. Smells of lots of fresh tropical fruity hops - grapefruit, mango, lemon, pineapple, tangerine - as well as some weaker floral hops, malt, vanilla and bread. Some weaker dank notes at the end. Taste follows the nose, but there was a decent hit of hoppy bitterness towards the middle and finish that wasn't unpleasant, just a little more sharp than I was accustomed to. I also expected more juiciness and I just didn't get it - maybe that left more harshness of the hops. Good, solid, mellow, mild mouthfeel and good carbonation. Not really sticky. I was just expecting a softer mouthfeel, akin to Heady Topper, Tree House Green and some other world-class NE-style IPAs. A great effort, but I'll keep looking for Heady.",4.23
Focal Banger,"Translucent golden straw color with a slight haze. Fluffy, no e white head that eventually disappears, leaving lacing along the glass as I drink. Some visible carbonation steaming up from the bottom. ",4.27
Focal Banger,"Strong piney aroma precedes a very hoppy flavor. Although the Alchemist insists one drink this fine brew from the can, I did pour a bit into a glass, and the color was a very pale gold color. It ain’t no Heady, but it’s pretty darn good!",4.05
Focal Banger,"From the monster can, it pours a hazy amber with a nice thick white head that slowly dissipates and leaves lacing. In the nose, it is spicy hoppy. In the mouth, it is oddly spicy hoppy.",4.05
Focal Banger,"Maybe it's denial or maybe it's just out of stubborn contempt, but I've always been a proponent of remaining loyal to flagship beers over the popular trend of picking the second most popular beer and claiming that it tastes better (e.g. Blind Pig over Pliny; Another One over Lunch, etc.)",4.52
Focal Banger,Thanks to my work/brewing friend Jacob for bringing this back from VT for me.,4.39
Focal Banger,Drank straight from the can (as recommended) but poured a little out in a separate glass to judge appearance.,4.72
Focal Banger,"Traded for this ages ago and finally got around to reviewing it tonight. To me, this is one of the classics and even though I tend to prefer newer offerings over this, this is a beer that I'd never pass up as it's so enjoyable and easy to quaff, down to the last drop!",4.35
Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,"L - not sure how this one has eluded me for so long. Pours a thick murk. I'd say yellow, but it's a dark shade of yellow, almost brown. Oily head with a rainbow sheen.",4.74
Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,"Mother of god this one was tasty. At first I thought I had a ""regular"" Trillium Congress Street, then realized I'd somehow scored the DDH version (found it online). Canned date 8/9/19 so I made sure to try this one fresh. And it knocked my socks off! Loved the look - reminded me of some of the best Tree House offerings. Very hazy yellow color with lots of fluffy white head and thick sheets and rings of lingering lacing that clung to the glass and did not fade away. Aromas of pineapple, grapefruit, mango, papaya, tangerine, passionfruit and guava; also malt, caramel, creamy vanilla and some weaker floral hops. Some dankness in the background. Taste follows the nose, great balance between the slightly bitter hops and sweeter malt backbone. Extremely juicy. At first I was going to give the smell/taste ratings of 4/4.25 since they were surprisingly muted and I was disappointed. But then as the beer warmed a little the second glass was incredible, more pungent and flavorful and complex with more depth. This is what I was looking for! Mouthfeel was incredible, soft, pillowy, luscious, sticky, smooth, coated the palate. Perfect amount of carbonation. Just an outstanding beer and I am lucky to have acquired other Trillium beers to try.",4.53

Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 4/11/2017. Pours opaquely hazy golden/orange/green color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, white bread dough, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, white bread dough, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very mild pine, herbal, grassy, zesty bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, berry, citrus peel/zest, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, white bread dough, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and bready malt flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance; and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is fantastic. Zero warming alcohol for 7.2%. Overall this is an outstanding NEIPA! All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical hops and bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the very mildly bitter/drying finish. Outstanding soft feel for the style. Very juicy and lightly dank Galaxy hop complexity; balanced pale/wheat malt backbone, not overly sweet/heavy for the style. Held up extremely well considering the can dating. I'm sure fresh would be mind blowing, as I had regular Congress Street a while ago.

Framboise Du Fermier,L: Pours a bright ruby red that recedes into a slight cloudy cranberry hue with a light pink foam and ample lacing ,4.75
Framboise Du Fermier,"WAY too damn sour, puckering to say the least. Raspberries are normally one of my personal favorites added to a sour but this is utterly acidic and rough. Cant say I'd go after this again. not my jam and the side project label is what is carrying this in my opinion.",3.67
Framboise Du Fermier,"while the side project wild beers have certainly been tending more acidic over the least year or so, in some instances, i think the higher acidity really works, and this is a great example of that. another one of the fruited fermier beers, up there with my favorites in the series, the plum, the cherry, and the blueberry, and i think the clean sourness that ramps up towards the end is part of what makes it. there is a lot of fruit in here, and a serious jammy sweetness is contributed by the raspberries, so the sour almost works to enhance and balance it, and with all the oak this has on it, along with the lemony funk, the drying cereal grain base, and the obvious maturity, its a complex and balanced brew that delivers what it seems to promise. i am not sure if this was aged in wine barrels or not, but it sure seems like it was, some notes of red and black currant in here, a tart cherry thing, and even a light strawberry thing, they all make it seem vinous to me, so does all the tannins in here. i even get trace watermelon flesh, juicy fruit gum, and red wine vinegar. suffice it to say there is quite a bit of depth to this. the fruit is insanely natural, really forward, and expressed beautifully through this base saison. almost as intense as i remember them being in the raspe, although i know this has to be less per barrel right? i also like it being a little stronger here, seems to slow me down, allow it to warm and open, and cut some of the flavor intensity with a little palate clearing alcohol. brilliant stuff, good carbonation too, especially compared to a few of the others in the series. the beat goes on for side project!",4.46
Framboise Du Fermier,Bottle pour.,4.34
Framboise Du Fermier,"Wow the smell on this beer is just heavenly. Full of fresh raspberries, full of tartness and sweetness. Basically liquid raspberry in pure sour saison form. Has all of the complex and beautifully balanced flavors and feel from the original, but now has a fresh fruit to star up front. Mouthfeel finish did feel a little grainy and acidic on the end, but I'm just nitpicking at this point.",4.73
Framboise Du Fermier,"B2 shared on 8-19-18(Fermier Day). Pours on the lighter shade of ruby(it was the lightest shade compared with Quetsche, Kriek, and Bluet). Nice raspberry funk on the nose. An initial raspberry flavor hits the palate, but for some strange reason quickly fades as my acidic ""woo"" reaction kicks in. I've read so many reviews here with the same ""jam/jammy"" comments, and I was very disappointed when I finally got to try this coveted brew, because those 2 words are far from the truth. Jam is sweet, something you put on bread(or crackers if you really want to be Mr. Fancy Pants). This beer is strongly acidic, dare I say overly so.",4.22
Framboise Du Fermier,B2 Bottle at Fermier Day,4.73
Framboise Du Fermier,"Easily the best I've ever had from Side Project. It's fantastic, and the raspberries shine through perfectly. It also strikes a great balance between its tartness and its drinkability.",4.77
Framboise Du Fermier,Some of Side Projects finest! Had this alongside a 2011 Cantillon LPF and this was better. Purchased this bottle along with many others of its caliber for a small group tasting and it was definitely one of the stars!,4.96
Framboise Du Fermier,"Can't help but notice the beautiful color of this brew first. A bright red, almost pink hue w excellent carb bubbles dancing the drunken dance they do. I love atrial, and it's natural to compare the 2 brews, but this can go toe to toe with it most certainly! Be prepared for that tart doe, loved how it felt.",4.77
Framboise Du Fermier,"Shared from a 750 at the cellar. A Beautiful beer with strong fruit nose, a wonderful balance of tartness. As it warms up it gets better. Reminded me of my Aunt Edna jarring her own jelly in the kitchen when I was a kid. Phenomenal.",4.8
Framboise Du Fermier,"Tasted this as part of a fruited Fermier set. The nose promised an acidic affair, but was quite soft upon tasting. This was my second favorite fruited Fermier to the Abricot. A really nice beer, but perhaps its rarity is driving up ratings a bit.",4.58
Framboise Du Fermier,"The nose on this was absolutely incredible. Huge punch in your face of raspberries, raspberries, and yup, more raspberries. Cold it was more raspberry juice, the saison side only really shined as it warmed up. I really think though that fruited wild ale, like Atrial, is better than fruited saison. Beautiful beer, but I still prefer Saison du Fermier over this.",4.81
Framboise Du Fermier,"750 B1. Huge thanks to Matt for opening this one. Incredible raspberry nose. Amazing. Taste is mildly sour for a SP, raspberry and lemon. Very balanced. No harsh acidity. Truly amazing stuff.",4.58
Framboise Du Fermier,"Super intense raspberries on the nose and taste. Just explodes all over the palate. As if the raspberries weren't enough, the carbonation is lively and the prickly sensation is like pop rocks candy on the tongue. Maybe get some subtle hints of lemon and oak, but the sour raspberry jam overwhelms everything else. This was quite the experience, but wouldn't want to drink a lot of it.",4.5
Framboise Du Fermier,"The perfect beer. Don't drink too cold! Once it warms up / reaches ~50F it opens up and balances perfectly. Tons and tons of fruit in the nose. Super jammy, starts as a sour, when warmed opens up as a saison. Fantastic brew.",5
Framboise Du Fermier,"Part of a share in Pittsburgh. Pours deep red without much head. Aroma of huge jammy raspberries, acidic funk, a bit of yeast and wheat malts. Flavor is full of jammy raspberries, over the top, in a good way. There isn't much from the amazing base beer left here, but I'm not complaining. The raspberries are so plentiful, this thing is amazingly delicious. Mostly a sour, less a saison, but altogether one of the best beers I've ever had. Reminds me a bit of Atrial, but this might be slightly better. Get it if you can.",4.77
Framboise Du Fermier,"Poured from a bottle into a FW snifter, 4oz pour next to '14 Framboos",4.86
Framboise Du Fermier,"750 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Deep pink/purple body. Hazy. Small white head. Raspberry and white wine. Almost all raspberry. Some yeast that reminds you its a saison. Sharp sourness. Sour raspberry. Some raspberry sweetness. A little bit musty. White wine finish. Medium light. A bit too sour for me. The raspberry flavor is good, but it dominates everything. Missing some of the quality of the base beer.",3.9
Framboise Du Fermier,On tap at HF FOFA 2015. Batch 3. HF Taster glass.,4.5
Framboise Du Fermier,Deep purplish red color. Very nice carb level and retention. Huge raspberry nose with some lemon and funk. The best fruited wild I've had. Wonderful integration. The Saison du Fermier base shines with loads of tartness and microflora but the finish is fresh raspberry. Wonderful beer.,5
Framboise Du Fermier,"Fresh picked raspberry on the nose fresh but morphed into a barnyard wild nose. A lot of raspberry tart on the taste needed with the side project saison taste. Finish was a lot rough, but hard to complain. Fantastic beer.",4.79
Framboise Du Fermier,"Absolutely stunning looking beer. Smell is rich and fruity. Nice raspberry flavor, a bit rough around the edges. Good, but not on the level of the apricot version.",4.36
Framboise Du Fermier,Multiple sample pours at the 2015 HF Festival of Farmhouse Ales. Pours a beautiful red/ruby color. Lot of raspberries and oak in the smell. Taste was very acidic and seemed to overpower the other things going on with the beer which prevented this from being rated higher.,4.32
Framboise Du Fermier,"This was one of my top three from the 2015 HF Festival of Farmhouse Ales. Incredible raspberry flavor, but still balanced with that fantastic Side Project tartness. Just stunning.",5
Green,Picked up 2 cases of beer 2 weeks ago from Treehouse. 2 of those cans were this. I've drank one of them. This review is based on that beer.,4.15
Green,"Guys. Wow. Wow... I love this beer because of one reason: simplicity. And I feel the same way about Pliny. It may not be the most flavorful. It may not be like going home with Rihanna after the Grammys, but damn it’s just so smooth! And that’s what we have here. This beer is just so damn soft! Soft, smooth melons, well, like Rihanna! And that’s it! It’s not complex like Trump’s tax returns! It’s simply like ordering a moons over my hammys at Denny’s.",4.28
Green,A: Murky yellow/gold with thick foam and massive lacing. ,4.42
Green,"Drank along with Julius for comparison. This was more golden with slight haze, adequate head with good lacing and retention. Sharp on the nose with more earthy notes and hints of herb and pine. I really like galaxy hops and was excited about this, but I didn’t care for it. I thought there was very little citrus or funk here. It was dry, herby, and mineral with significant bitterness. On the other hand, it got better as I drank and I appreciated the full bodied complexity. Can’t say I would seek it again though. If you are expecting a NEIPA, you might be thrown off.",3.88
Green,Poured from a 16 oz can into a Zywiec tulip,4.65
Green,"From a can dated 7/18/19. Another superb TH IPA. This Galaxy hopped offering has an excellent blend of tropical notes along with a piney, somewhat bittery note that distinguishes it from other IPAs. Highly drinkable, and not a hint of booziness. Deserving of elite status.",4.6
Green,"Canned 7/26/19. ""FERDA""",4.7
Green,my intro to tree house beers. This beer is as good a usage of galaxy as any. The problem I see with a lot of other breweries galaxy heavy beers is they don't retain as much of the bitterness that I would like to have. Green has a good of tropical notes and bitterness. This is a beer I could have time and time again.,4.52
Green,"A pale orange body, slight translucence on the side, off white head, moderate bubbled lacing. Nose is orange juice, the taste introduces a pungent grassy hop line. Mild bitterness in the finish. Deliciously drinkable.",4.58
Green,"Just. Amazing. All the hype is true. I tried so hard not to let my preconceived notions of this beer sway me - I'd heard all the hype, read some reviews (although I tried to stay away from many of them), know all about the mystique surrounding Tree House Brewing Company. Managed to find a trio of Tree House IPAs online and couldn't save them for a special occasion as I wanted to sample them as fresh as possible. This one was the oldest - canned on 3/27/19 - so it was first up to bat. And oh man was this an amazing NE-style IPA. Clearly the best I've ever had. Looked absolutely outstanding - hazy pale yellow color, layers and layers of pillowy-soft fluffy white head and abundant sheets of lingering lacing that lasted forever. I gave it a 4.75 rating for look, just out of principle of not giving 5s, but I'm not sure how much better a beer could have looked. Smells incredible, loads of fresh citrus juicy fruit - pineapple, orange, tangerine, grapefruit, a little lemon - with some more faint floral hops and malt in the distant background. Taste follows the nose, and that sweeter malt backbone was very restrained and tame. That was good since there wasn't as much of a bitter hoppy hit as I was expecting at the finish. The mouthfeel was out of this world - soft, inviting, pillowy, luscious, slightly sticky. Smooth, creamy and juicy and perfect carbonation balance. Honestly I can't believe this beer had a higher ABV as it was like drinking some sort of luscious juicy summer concoction. Well done, Tree House. Well done.",4.69
Green,"Wonderful NE style IPA pours a beautiful hazy gold color. The aroma on this thing jumped out of the glass, so much citrus and tropical flavors, mango, pineapple, a little less bitterness than Julius, but enough that it’s balanced. Mouthfeel is like a freakin pillow and the finish is crisp and juicy. This exceeded expectations.",4.8
Green,"Textbook New England IPA. Combining American and Australian hops. Hazy gold, beautifully complex as the USA-Aussie hops engage in a full rugby scrum in your mouth. Fabulous beer!",4.5
Green,"Was giving a 16oz. Can from a customer of mine from Connecticut who knows I’m an IPA junkie. This brew is the bomb. Unfortunately, from what I understand I won’t be able to find this anytime soon at my local outlets in Pennsylvania.",4.9
Green,I like everything about this except for the smell. It smells exactly like a frat house the day after a party with all that beer in the carpet. Exactly.,3.68
Green,"Look - hazy, dark orange, not a lot of head or lacing",4.05
Green,"Pours yellow orange with a thinnish white head (might have been poor pour technique on my part, though). A light, almost effervescent taste that I really love. Insanely easy-drinking for a 7.5 ABV. While I wouldn’t quite rate it with my TH faves Julius and Haze, this is another monster beer from the folks in central MA.",4.68
Green,"Served in my Spiegelau IPA glass. Pours a dull orange with a hazy clarity and a tight, fluffy, one inch, off-white head embedded with tiny pinpricks. Head eventually settles into a consistent, 1/8th inch cap with delicate textured strands of lacing revealed as it disperses. Great nose - citrus pith, rind and a hint of tropical fruit (perhaps guava). Taste follows nose, with the addition of a kiss of breadiness at the finish that lightly lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an even carbonation and a touch of acidity. Not much to say about this one. Quite tasty and characteristic of the style. Happy to have had the chance to try it.",4.04
Green,"Had this on 2019-01-22 in Columbia, PA from a 16oz canned on 2019-01-01 (they were working on New Year's Day?)",4.49
Green,Canned on 1/1. Poured to Birrateque IPA 18OZ Glass on 1/4.,4.61
Green,"Easily my top 3 from TreeHouse. This thing is packed to the brim with Galaxy which is just such a delicious hop. Massive crisp juicy notes on everything here, mouth feel is god like, is anyone surprised, TH is world class.",5
Green,Citrus on the nose. Taste the orange and pineapple. Very hazy can’t see through my spiegelau ipa glass. Wonderful mouth feel. Nice bitterness at the end.,4.75
Green,"L: similar color to lime juice, orange juice, or mango juice. Small head that quickly dissipates",4.5
Green,A galaxy hop focused beer! My favorite beer from Tree House. Worth the drive and the wait in line. Beautifully crafted time and time again. My hats off to Tree House for creating this and keeping it coming. Only thing that tops it in my opinion is Very Green! Cheers!!!!,4.48
Green,A world of thanks to Brian for this one. Pint can dated 9/19/18 - poured into a tulip at 44f. ,4.57
Green,"A strong pour was needed for a finger sized rocky off white head with average retention and spotty lacing. A cap lasted to the bottom. Labeled can,10/30/18. ",4.56
Very GGGreennn,A- Tallboy pours into a snifter with a chalky and floury yellow orange body. A thick and truly creamy white cap rises out of the beer to an inch high with amazing retention. Tons of lacing in thick blankets around the glass.,4.69
Very GGGreennn,"Canned 06/07/19, 10:48:01.",4.58
Very GGGreennn,"Maybe it's because Treehouse is so readily available to me but I was a bit let down by this one. I went to the brewery because Juice Machine was on tap but it kicked only a few hours into the day so they tapped Very Gggreen. I had read good things about Very Green and I understand Very Gggreen is a rarity to find, so I snagged a draft for $8.",4.2
Very GGGreennn,"From can into pint glass, less than 1 month from canning date.",4.99
Very GGGreennn,"Near perfect NEIPA. Drinks like it's 4% without any of the bitterness green has. Amplifies everything you like about very green and dials it up a couple notches. mouthfeel is softer than even Very Green. Soft citrus and ripe pineapple combine to make this beer amazing. The mouthfeel, taste, smell, all of it A+. Possibly my favorite IPA",5
Very GGGreennn,L: Light honeycomb and apricot hues with a rich foamy head and gratuitous lacing that clings throughout the session,4.99
Very GGGreennn,Opaque maize with a tall white head leaving full on spray paint walls of lacing.,4.2
Very GGGreennn,"Perfect hazy yellow color. Beautiful sweet and bright to nose, thick and smooth body. Sharp and crisp taste with a still present hop bite. Perfect for anyone who likes this hop profile. Also, love the 5th element quote on the can “Corbin Corbin, My man I have no fire.”",4.61
Very GGGreennn,"Big thanks to rudzud for hooking me up, canned 6/07/19",4.84
Very GGGreennn,About as perfect of an IPA as you can get. ,4.77
Very GGGreennn,"Picked-up four cans at the Tree House brewery in Charlton for about five dollars. Canned-on date of 6/7/19. My forty eighth beer from these guys. Had 2 the night of game 7, but was not rational enough to review, given the result. Extremely good, a little bit of hop burn, just behind Very Green for my favorite TH beer (have had JM & Jjj, not KJ or KJjj). 2 Cases of Baby Bright for 1 KJjj?",4.75

Very GGGreennn,Picked up a 4 pack of this at the brewery on release. ,4.84
Very GGGreennn,TREE HOUSE VERY GGGREENNN DIPA 6/9/19,4.77
Very GGGreennn,"Pours super hazy, orange-gold in color with 1/4 inch head. Taste is big honeydew melon, bubblegum, orange creamsicle and pineapple. Heavy bodied, sweet, with moderate carbonation. Wow is there a burn at the back end of this beer. Super hop saturation. Very thick. A total sipper of an ipa. Gggreennn blew me away. This one is great, but is not as mind blowing an experience as that beer. Still exceptional.",4.54
Very GGGreennn,"L - been waiting for this one... Green, arguably Tree House's best beer, and the stutters and Very's that follow seem hard to top. This should be the top, right? Pours a hazed-up Green. Starts dark on the top and lightens up down toward the bottom. Hard to tell if that's the reflection of the can, but I'm getting a radioactive swamp monster vibe. Milky gradient of yellow to deep orange with some serious head fluff. Lacing clings to the glass, but the oily foam remains, jiggling like jell-o.",4.88
Very GGGreennn,"Forget everything you know about IPAs. Forgot everything you thought you knew about New England IPAs. This takes everything to an entirely new level. Absolutely mind blowing. The look is just crazy, too.",5
Very GGGreennn,Batch Canned 6/07/19 and reviewing based on 2 cans consumed within 2 days of canning,4.98
Very GGGreennn,I saw this posted and ran out to the brewery as soon as I could (damn conference calls). Everything you love about 'Green' cranked up. Super hazy. Super creamy. Super citrusy. Just awesome.,4.79
Very GGGreennn,"Pours a completely opaque vibrant gold. The nose is full on pineapple and honeydew with a bubblegum garnish. The taste follows, but the honeydew is punched up to the 10th degree. Tastes like creamy fruit juice with a slightly drying and grassy back end. Taste sticks around to the next swallow. Where has this beer been all my life? LARRRRRRRRGE!!!",4.78

Lou Pepe - Framboise,From a bottle shared at la fête de la brasserie de la Pleine Lune 2019. ,4.74
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"The beer pours a ruby red with a big fluffy pink head. It has medium high carbonation. The beer smells of raspberries, funk, almonds, and vanilla. It tastes lightly tart, with raspberries, almonds, vanilla, and light funk. The feel is very light and dry. A tasty lambic from Cantillon.",4.64
Lou Pepe - Framboise,75cl bottle drank at the brewery in Brussels. Poured into 25cl Cantillon glass,4.54
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Bottle at brewery. Ruby hued body with a sudsy, quickly dissipating pale pink head. Smells exactly like a fresh picked raspberry crushed between the fingers. Taste is like a raspberry with the sweetness mostly sucked out of it: the tartness from the natural innoculation complements the inherent raspberry tartness very well. Medium bodied with a lingering fruity character. Complex and elegant ",4.61
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"08/2015 - Raspberry jam fosho, tannic, funk, and barnyard up front; very tart, big acidity, more raspberries, and just jam on the palate; flavorful finish of raspberry, cherry, and a wee bit of pepper to round it out.",4.6

Lou Pepe - Framboise,This one poured a bright red with a slight pink head that didn't last long.,4.71
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"a 2010 vintage generously shared with me after quite literally years of anticipating this bottle together. its incredible stuff, worth the wait, and as good as anything i have had from these guys really, every bit as good as the lou kriek or the fou. deep dusty brick red in color, dense with fruit here, not as electric and bright looking as a lot of raspberry beers, and with a fizzy lazy head, not super robust there. the nose is mind melting for me, pure raspberry and insanely mature lambic funk and tartness, turbid wheaty aged hop base, tons of oak and brett, a well developed wild acidity as well, this is rather piquant, and then of course all the berry, as natural as it gets and like stuffing an entire handful of them in my face, as intense as can be. i smell it for awhile before i taste it, so complex and mouthwatering and inviting. great sourness up front in the flavor highlights the fruit right from the start, with the sturdy wood and mature wildness right there with it, tart and red winey towards the finish, a little sweet from the fruit, still malty in a lambic sense, and really brightly acidic and interesting. the complexity of the yeast elements here is as good as it gets, and why cantillon is so well regarded as far as i am concerned. the raspberries are perfect with it, and really bold in this beer. the maturity is unrivaled and the flavor is just incredible. beautiful lambic, famous for a reason, and probably even more striking to me now in terms of quality because there are so many lackluster fruited sours out there in the world. this is the cream!",4.6
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2012 bottle poured into a stemmed tulip. Beautiful looking beer. Deep burgundy in color. Pinkish white head that dissipates quick. Aromas of raspberry and funk. Some earthiness in there. Flavor is tart raspberries and funk. More tart than I thought it’d be. Feelnis as you’d expect for this style. Overall, another outstanding Cantillon beer.",4.54
Lou Pepe - Framboise,2014 vintage at the brewery.,4.7
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"750 ml, 2012 (bottled/released fall 2015). Pours between brick and blood red, slightly hazy, and with minimal head. Nose takes you down two roads. Fresh and acidic/preserved cherries and raspberries and ice cream come through. Alongside, dandelions, hay, Brett, and tart apple. Fruit is amazing compared to Rose de Gambrinus. I think this will be my first ever 5 for nose. Flavor has acidity and intensity of straight raspberry juice paired with funky lemon peel and a fresh herbal greenery that is hard to place. Almost like an intense mixed drink. Prickly crisp carbonation. Funky monkey this is a good beer, even compared to other Cantillon beers. Honestly, the intensity will make this 750 ml bottle an all afternoon affair.",4.64
Lou Pepe - Framboise,2013 vintage.,4.68
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Had at Cantillon brewery, from bottle. ",4.52
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Bottle with a 2013 sticker. Reluctant to rate because this is such a distinctive beer, at once subtle and strong, and this is the first time I've had anything by Cantillon. I found it amazing, but also palate challenging. It's kind of like first time listening to Coltrane. You're not sure how to describe it or judge it, and you're at once thrilled and in over your head, but you know repetition seems really worth pursuing and will alter your tastes.",4.46
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2012 sticker poured into a fluted glass. While this beer is visually striking with a lovely raspberry scent, the taste and mouthfeel are the stars here. Fantastic balance of funk, fruit and sour. Even a hour after opening there is still huge carbonation. A complete joy. One of the best beers I've ever had.",4.93
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2013 bottle. That was EXTREME, could feel the smell from the bottle and the off flavors here were kind of unpleasant in the first 15-20 minutes. The funk was so strong we couldnt have the first sip, and i'm not talking about horsey aromas but some kind of fishey/rotten food/mold and more. After waiting for the beer to get warmer the aromas morphed into something more fruity and the framboise finally came up. Very very sour on the palate, mid carbonation. What an experience this was, scary and amazing!",4.06
Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2013 sticker at Hopyard in Oslo. This was a pleasant surprise and a real treat.

Aaron,Batch 1,4.8
Aaron,"Tasted from bottle. Pours a dark ruby brown. Caramel and molasses on aroma. Sticky thick mouthfeel. Flavors of caramel, brown sugar, dates, raisins, butterscotch. Incredible English barleywine.",4.75
Aaron,"So wow, honestly one the finest BA Barleywines I have every had.... Poured into a 13 oz Game Of Thrones Glass aged for 2 years in bourbon barrels bottled in the last two months. Pours a gorgeous chestnut with a 2 plus finger off white head that leaves a few thin wisps of lace. 4.75",4.52
Aaron,Had on tap at HFB after bottle run. Absolutely extraordinarily perfect high octane version of a English Barleywine. Had a beautiful if brief light tan head; excellent residual lacing. Rich tawny orange- ruby accented color. Like a beautiful piece teak. Both simple and then complex to light.,5
Aaron,"Bottle. I have been waiting for this bitch for ages. I tried both the 2016 & 2018 batches. This was one of my biggest wants because I figured Hill Farmstead does everything else great, I bet they would nail a Barleywine as well. Oh, and it is barrel aged for like an eon. Aaron pours a dark brown. Not necessarily clear bodied behind the tint of the beer. A thin, defeated ring of diminutive bubbles rest steadily around the outer conversion of beer and glass; the only thing minute about this beer. The aroma rises out of the glass like a slothful perfume. Thick, damp whiffs of bourbon, raisins, toffee, and dessert wine. Detailed, rich, royal. The flavor marches in line with the nose. Heavy, sweet, and decadent. I think the older batch has a bit more complexity but lacks the barrel character of it's newer kin. I get some flavors of boozy dates and maple syrup from both, though. Of course the feel stands abreast with the other elements of the beer. Portly, heavy, and warming. Toothsome but intense. Definitely lived up to the hype I personally gave this beer. The best Barleywine I have ever had.",4.75
Aaron,Opaque chestnut brown with a moderate fuzzy tan blanket that slowly settles to the thinnest ring and a smooth slick surface. A tilt leaves an impressive span of clear legs on the glass.,4.32
Aaron,"A: Pours a deep murky brown color with a beige colored head. Head is somewhat creamy, has very decent volume considering the aging done on this beer but dissipates quite quickly to a ring.",4.75
Aaron,"Pours thick to a teku, nearly-opaque dark brown with ruby highlights. Half a finger of head, with a persistent thick dusting that lingers around the rim and is revitalized by swirling. Redolent on the nose, vanilla and brown sugar with bourbon spice on top. Plum, tobacco, and raisin join the fray on the palate. Delicate, richly textured and complex, with a lot of barrel character lurking. Tremendous on every dimension.",4.68
Aaron,"4 oz. onsite, ""2015 Aaron""",4.59
Aaron,"12/2016 - Freshly acquired and immediately enjoyed; so much raisin, plum, tobacco, some apple brandy (not as much bourbon) on the nose; big, boozy plum and tobacco on the palate; semisweet, fairly dry finish.",4.62
Aaron,"on nose is oak, vanilla, caramel, leather, bourbon, and very subdued booze. palate is massive sugary dark fruits. plum, cherry, fig, spice, raisin, brown sugar roasted almonds, marshmallow, caramel, vanilla, bourbon. the complexity is rich in this one, and im probably not able to pick out all the fruity and spiced notes because this is a style i dont drink often. regardless it is clear that the base beer integrates beautifully with bourbon character, and the overall result is immensely complex and smooth - an unbelievably delicious offering.",4.8
Aaron,"Poured from fridge temp into a snifter. Pours a dark murky brown with quickly dissipating tan head. Nose is very bourbon forward, with notes of nuts, grapes, toffee, brown sugar. Taste is amazing. Feels like a 15 year old English barley wine laced with bourbon. Has those amazing bourbon notes, along with caramel, brown sugar, maple, cherries, and figs. Has a syrupy feel to it. It tastes great, but I must say it is not my favorite BA barley wine. That's not to say this isn't amazing - just didn't live up to the hype. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous. Overall, a great BA barley wine and worth seeking out if this is your style.",4.34
Aaron,Certainly not a bad beer but I find Barleywines too sweet for my liking and this one was no different. I also didn’t notice a massive difference between this and other barleywines from local brewers,4
Aaron,Batch 2 (2016).,4.58

Aaron,"This one pours a nice looking brown/ruby with a thin head that breaks into a cap and collar. The cap doesn't last long, and the collar leaves some minor lacing in its wake.",4.72
Aaron,Look: Mahogany brown with big fluffy white head. Has medium carbonation.,4.68
Aaron,"I've not had a ton of HF beers, but everyone I've had is delicious and this was no exception. An aroma of bourbon and stone fruits and the taste was smooth bourbon, stone fruit and brown sugar. Probably one of the best English style BW I've had the pleasure of having.",4.84
Aaron,"Pours a dark brown color with a small beige head, collapsing to a small ring of lacing.",3.92
Aaron,"Deep brown pour, reddish hues, smaller offwhite head that bubbles out, lighter carbonation. Aroma of brown sugar, caramel, toffee, vanilla, whiskey - just fantastic. Sweet caramel up front, bourbon,vanilla, toffee, slight fruit. Medium body with low carbonation, no alcohol heat whatsoever. I didnt want this bottle to end.",4.76
Aaron,"Had on tap. Pretty close to a perfect execution of the english barleywine style with the american bourbon aging flare incorporated beautifully. The feel and smell are mesmerizing with their richness and complexity. All aspects, including the taste, have the barrel character meld wonderfully with the barleywine malt, barley and yeast.

Sip Of Sunshine,"Slightly hazy burnt golden body with bubbly white head. Citrus rind, papaya, pine, spearmint, lemon skin in the nose. Tastes of citrus rind, pine, spearmint, lemon skin, papaya, fruit gives way to hop bitterness at the finish. Heavy bodied with medium carb.",4.34

Sip Of Sunshine,"This beer gets hyped up so much, and boy did it fail to live up to the hype. Sure it's a good beer. But calling it world class is a load of garbage. Just your classic ipa, bitter hint of citrus but just not too interesting. Definitely not warranting of the top rating it gets. ",3.85
Sip Of Sunshine,"16oz can dated ""30JUL19,"" reviewed on 8/10/19. Slightly hazy, golden in color. Citrusy, floral aroma that's very muted and disappointing. It smells like your average west coast IPA. I'm getting no tropical fruit notes at all, and this is a fairly fresh can. The flavor profile follows suit -- fairly dry, moderate apparently bitterness, not at all ""juicy."" Grassy, pithy, and other associated flavor notes that you would associate with what are now considered ""classic"" American IPAs. ",3.41
Sip Of Sunshine,"On the lighter side of golden , not hazy with a nice thick and shrinking white head. Citrus first, fruity behind nose. I’m sure at one time this was ground breaking stuff. Ok, the first thing that strikes me is the thickness and fullness of flavor. This puppy is more malty than I would have expected, more west coast in that respect. A bit more bitter than the New England styles I’m trying these days. The feel and lesser carbonation is spot on with this beer. Good stuff.",4.22

Sip Of Sunshine,"This is my favorite readily available (sort of ...) IPA. Living in MA, it's easy to find locally if you find out what day the distributor makes a drop off at your local liquor store. As a hater of juicy IPA beers, I like the lemon and resin combination of this. It has to be fresh and cold ... if its warm or even lukewarm it can be as harsh as lemon pledge. However, ice cold, there isn't another beer I crave as much.",4.86
Sip Of Sunshine,I prefer double IPAs but this is a very good single IPA. Lots of floral flavor. Have had this both on tap and from the can and both are great - similar to alchemists heady topper in the sense that the smell is the best part (IMO),4.65

O: Aged 3.5 years to be drinkable still starts hot when chilled, nice tartness but a bit boozy and sweet! So many better big stouts. Not up to this hype.",4.02
Black Tuesday,2016 release consumed 5.1.18. Amazing express of the style. Drinks soft and smooth for 20% abv. More like an old ale look but drinks like a stout. Heavy booze and chocolate.,4.43
Black Tuesday,"Huge beer! 2014 version. Pours jet black with minimal head. Aroma is lots of raisin and dates, caramel and bourbon. Hides ridiculous high abv very well. Only a slight hint of booziness. Lots of dark fruits, caramel, molasses, almost a little cherry, cocoa. Awesome, complex huge beer.",4.74

Black Tuesday,Black as tar. Dark roasted chocolate and nuts. Doesn’t drink like 19%. Love the aftertaste and it feels coating and smooth. Abv does not allow for lacing at all.,4.55
Black Tuesday,"03/2014 - 2011 vintage - Wow, this is boozy but amazing! Bourbon, wood, caramel nose; velvety, hot, chocolate, oak all over mouthfeel; lasting finish. It's intense but yum!",4.31
Black Tuesday,"Good lord what an experience! Look is cola with some alcohol legs. Not the best looking Impy Stout by a long shot. But look is by far the least important attribute, and at nearly 20%, it wasn’t going to look like beer anyways. Nose is world-class! Bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, coconut, prunes, tobacco, leather, malts. Possibly the best beer I’ve ever smelled. The taste follows the complexity of the nose with a huge alcohol punch. Mouthfeel is velvety with a mild prickly carbonation. Overall a word class beer that might benefit from the ABV being dialed down just a tad. Worth seeking out for sure!",4.96
Black Tuesday,"Opened a bottle today that I obtained direct from brewery last Dec. It has been stored at 36F most of the time. I had a taste of another bottle in December, and it immediately reminded me of BCBS, but with some difference in character. It had a more pronounced dark fruit flavor. After 8 months of cold storage, I finally tried my bottle, and it immediately grabbed me with its strong, mellow flavors, and its similarity to BCBS. I now find it better than BCBS, as it seems to have stronger flavors. Beautiful dark, sweet flavors of raisins and plums, along with strong bourbon and barrel flavors, plus a good dose of alcohol. Label says it ""contains alcohol"". No kidding.",4.89
Black Tuesday,"Well, lets just do it. Pouring a 2016 bottle from a 750 ml. into a tulip glass. This beer poured surprisingly lighter in color than most of similar style. It had medium brown highlights throughout the whole pour. Forms in the glass dark, but even still with highlights around all edges. It formed a very thin and incomplete crown that was light tan in color. The smell is hot and boozy with big dark fruit notes like raisins, plums and figs. The taste comes in with those dark fruit notes again but now providing some cherry like element as well. It is definitely warm, but less than would ever be expected from a 40 proof bourbon barrel aged imperial stout. Finishes with that warmness mixing with some nice chocolate notes. Honestly though, I'm a little let down on the amount of flavor being delivered. Overall, this wasn't bad but I've definitely had better from the Bruery. I will give them the achievement of making a 40 proof stout that is drinkable as hell and the ABV that hidden tho.",3.99
Black Tuesday,Bottled on 10/05/17. Poured into a small snifter. ,3.49
Black Tuesday,"Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Small pour (8oz glass), so easily more head formation with a 12oz or larger pour. Aroma is roasted, toasted, and caramel malts with a swell of bourbon behind. Plum, toffee, and molasses give it a little extra boost. Aroma mellows as the beer warms, providing a kaleidoscope of dark stout flavors, with the alcohol receding into the background. Flavor profile is roasted, toasted, and caramel malts quickly followed by toffee, molasses, and bourbon. There is a boozy, heavy burn at the back fresh out of the fridge, but as it warms the bourbon turns to more of a warm liquid, as opposed to a molten express delivery of alcohol. The dense flavor profile covers up the near 20% ABV well, but the booze still peeks through, even after aging for a little over a year. Mouth feel is thick with a velvety, grainy texture. Overall, a hearty, boozy stout with a huge ABV. It remains well balanced all things considered, but the ABV still peaks through. ",4.51

Black Tuesday,"This beer is what turned me in to a craft beer lover. I tasted it in a flight years ago and began to hunt down stouts. Many disappointed, but it opened up my pallet to good beer in general. I wish I could find this beer near me!",4.94
Black Tuesday,Pours thin from a bottle very little head. On the nose I smell plum and candied apples. Definitely get the booze. Very syrupy on the finish. Lots of chocolate on the back end.,4.82
Black Tuesday,"I really wanted to like this. I’ve heard great things about the Bruery and decided to become a Society member to give them a try. This is supposed to be one of their best but sadly, like most of their beers, it’s just too sweet for my liking and very reminiscent of a dessert wine. I appreciate their ingenuity but I’m coming to the realization that their style, while interesting and complex, is just not my thing.",3.16
Black Tuesday,"2015 version. Not a great looking stout. Kinda thin/no head etc. Aroma is bourbon and cardboard. Big and boozy. Chocolate, bourbon and buttery greatness. Quite a great stout.",4.64
Black Tuesday,2016 at a bottle share. Looks and smells great but the booze really detracted from this one for me. The coffee in Mocha Wednesday helps mask it but drinking this one I was glad I only had a taster. I can't imagine opening a bottle for less than four people.,4.34

Overall - The nose is somewhat subdued but the flavor is powerful, smooth slightly creamy feel great beer.",4.56
Swish,"Murky gold with a quickly fading head. Nose is filled with citrus, flowers and grass. Lightly sweet with a ton of citrus. Great light body and excellent finishing bitterness. Great beer.",4.8
Swish,"Nose is clementines, caty pine. Taste follows juicy clementines with balancing pine/pith bitterness. Finishes dry and bitter. Mouthfeel is very good, full with some carbonation. Overall it is a good flagship ipa from Bissell.",4.45
Swish,Thank you SawDog505 for this can!!,4.45
Swish,Pours a hazy yellow with a thin white head. The smel of the beer is tropical fruity on the nose. The taste has a nice piney resin with some sweetness. The feel is smooth with a good amount of dry bitterness in the finish. Overall a very good beer.,4.34
Swish,"A bomb of grapefruit taste and smell. A little too much for me. Overpowering on the citrus side. Although, It is a beautiful composition of the brewers meticulous care. Let it slowly warm up and you will notice a change in complexity. Look, smell, taste and feel are all well crafted.",4.25
Swish,"Pours golden straw color with haze. Smells earthy with mild fruit tones - papaya, passionfruit, and grapefruit. Tastes mildly bitter with a dry finish. Medium body mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Overall, I think other Bissell offerings should rank higher than Swish such as Substance and Here's to Feeling Good all the Time. Not a bad beer, but definately shouldn't rank to the level it currently rates.",4.02
Swish,"Picked-up a four-pack in an in-person trade. Have heard of this brewery before, and always wanted to try (cannot get in MA). Very solid brew, does remind me of Julius, but with a much more more bitter aftertaste.",4.5
Swish,"Appearance: Pours hazy and goldenstraw colored, with a solid cap of foam that hangs around for a while, leaving swaths of lacing",4.29
Swish,I was disappointed with this one released 12/7 had one that afternoon and thought maybe too green waited a week and still didn’t love it. Had a metallic finish,3.63
Swish,"Want to try another can. Dated 12/12/18. Drank 12/28/18. Looks decent, smells great. Not much flavor. Get a quick bitterness on the tongue that is good but disapates into maltiness and a weak flavor. Slightly abervesent and good mouth feel for a NEIPA",3.96
Swish,"The Julius of Bissell Brothers. Just released today, and absolutely perfect! Juicy, hazy, smooth mouthfeel - everything an NEIPA could and should be. Worth the wait this morning! Get this if you can. Among the best out there, and should rank much higher on Maine’s best list.",5
Swish,Big thanks to Josh for hooking me up with a fresh 4pk of this. ,4.33
Swish,"02/2015 - I get why this is hyped - it's quite good; but it isn't my favorite Bissell. There's a lot of onion, fruity hops, piney aromas; sweet, tangy, well hopped flavors with some caramel too; a touch bitter, earthy finish, with some melon hanging around back.",4.33
Swish,"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Green Session. Hazy yellow color. Aroma is grainy with soft fruitiness and a bit floral. Taste is hoppy, juicy and grassy with a dry and bitter finish. Overall it's a juicy but also dry, west coast-ish IPA.",4.6
Swish,While this is a great beer I actually prefer Substance and Reciprocal. Lux is interesting in its own right since its a rye beer. Perhaps Swish is higher rated since it is so much harder to get. Regardless Bissell Brothers are making some great beers.,4.48
Swish,"Been a couple years since I last tried Swish, it was too astringent then, but it tastes damn close to perfect now. Starting from the back, there's a balanced citrus bitter finish. Moderate dankness and a hint of savory vegetable with the juicy fruit punch. The aroma is more floral, but still backed by big fruity hops. Lots and lots of delicious, well balanced hops.",4.34
Swish,"OK, this stuff is amazing. Pours a shade of gold that immediately lets you know you're in for a treat. Smell is actually fairly mild compared to how rich in flavor it is, with notes of general dankness, and some sweet fruitiness that becomes more apparent as it warms up. Mouthfeel is incredible, it's somehow smooth AND substantial. The flavor lands on your tongue with a bang, then leaves slowly, and gradually, as if it was melting, but wanted to take its time. One of the best beers I've ever had.",4.82
Swish,[IMG] Poured into my 16 oz Alchemist IPA glass canned on 3/23/18. Pours a very hazy yellow orange with a massive 2 finger off white head that leaves plenty of thin wisps of lace behind as it slowly settles into a thin film of bubbles. 4.5,4.74
Swish,A - Pours golden orange with a one finger foamy white head. Nice amount of soapy lacing.,4.52
Swish,Pint can (3/23/18) poured into a fat Duvel tulip glass on 3/30/18 ,4.62
Nectarine Premiere,My first De Garde taste. WOW! best brew i think i ever had.,5
Nectarine Premiere,Poured out as a slightly hazed orange color with a thin white head on top. The smell of the beer is packed with funky nectarine sourness which is to be expected from de Garde. The flavors are similar to the nosem lots of acidic funky nectarine coming in full speed from start to finish. The feel is light to medium bodied and dry. Overall it's a kick ass sour. So it's worthy seeking out if you're into that sort of thing.,4.25
Nectarine Premiere,"04/2016 - as it warms, the fruit, funk, and oak ripen and delight the senses; the nectarine is lovely, but doesn't overwhelm the senses; digging the mouthfeel of this; traditional dG acidity in the back of the palate; juicy, sour, funky finish.",4.62
Nectarine Premiere,"A: Pours a light straw color, soda-like fizz, with almost no head. ",4.63
Nectarine Premiere,Poured from a 750mL bottle into a oversized wine glass. Thank you Ryan for sharing this!,4.81
Nectarine Premiere,I had b2 last year and knew I had to get my hands on more. B3 isn't quite as fruity or have the same mouthfeel but nevertheless it's very similar. Best nose on any sour period. Many people comment how you can smell chocolate or coffee or other things and I've always thought that these were more resembling characteristics but this beer really does smell like straight nectarines and nothing else. Beautiful citrus. The level of sour and acidity are damn near perfect. I've had quite a few DeGarde beers and this is hands down my favorite right with Imperial Stone Bu. When I traded for the B2 with the Peach I thought the Peach was a total let down compared to this gem. Totally worth trying at least once.,4.81
Nectarine Premiere,Had this on draft on site at De Garde.,5
Nectarine Premiere,"Pours a hazy yellow color with only a few fuzzy bubbles on the surface. Aroma is fresh, unripened nectarines, grapefruit pearl, lemon, and fresh oak, and some granny smith apple. Taste is like biting into a fresh nectarine that is more tart than juicy. There's a little acetic acid and band aid as is common with De Garde. It has a full flavor while maintaining a light airy freshness throughout. I get a rich, white wine note as it warms along with grapefruit pith and sour lemon candy. Carbonation is minimal but just enough to move the beer along. It's very esay to drink the 750 in one sitting. This is a fantastic beer.",4.56
Nectarine Premiere,"Bottle on-site at de Garde. The aroma and flavor of this beer are incredible, but it had very low carbonation. Not sure if it was just the bottle I had or if that is typical. Either way, it is a great fruited wild ale.",4.45
Nectarine Premiere,"I don't see how a wild can get any better than this! Pour is nectarine orange and opaque, with a fizzy short lasting head, but a bountiful ring of nectarine pulp decorating the rim of the glass all the way around that's there to stay. Nose is definately nectarine with some peach and star fruit, and taste is all nectarine. Mouthfeel is softly carbonately and tart on the finish. This thing is so good. Nice job de Garde!",4.69
Nectarine Premiere,"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2017, red session. Really hazy, milky, bright vanilla color. Aroma has bright apricot and peach notes. Taste is tart an fruity with yogurt notes and dry on the finish.",4.6
Nectarine Premiere,"2016 vintage, poured into a taster. Huge stone fruit, as expected, well balanced with the wine barrel notes and typical dG funk. Very nicely done overall.",4.67
Nectarine Premiere,"Look- Nice orange color, my guess would be it was a nectarine sour just from looking at it poured in a glass.",4.79
Nectarine Premiere,Had a week ago.,5
Nectarine Premiere,"Really gorgeous beer here - and the oak wine barrels give it a nice complexity. I really wasn't even sure what a nectarine was, but I definitely know now!",4.37
Nectarine Premiere,"Appearance - nice white foam head that lingers, cloudy orange color that looks like OJ, Aroma has tons of citrus notes - the nectarine is immediately noticeable, slight funk notes as it warms - Taste is out of this world good - so much citrus juice-like acidity that compliments the lactic acid and makes this beer next level good. Body is full and balanced, sour with the citric & lactic acid but they pair so well together in this beer especially with the sweetness of the nectarine. Overall this beer has so much character and amazingly well made.",4.74
Nectarine Premiere,Opaque yellow with a large eggshell blanket.,4.82
Nectarine Premiere,drank on 10/27/2016. latest batch,4.71
Nectarine Premiere,"Pours fizzy apricot and cloudy. Smell and taste are all big citrus zest, tart apricot, some pulpy orange and blood orange. Feel is a bit fizzy, but works with the zest. Tasty, palate cleansing. Great beer",4.37
Nectarine Premiere,Golden orange. Looks like orange juice. White head.,4.61
Nectarine Premiere,"I think this is a little over hyped, but is still very solid. The most outstanding factor is the deep nectarine juicy-ness of the beer. I mean it has the essence of jammy. But the flavor is pretty one dimensional after that, tart, clean, smooth, decent body,",4.36
Nectarine Premiere,Pours a yellow and hazy color with small yellow head. Smells of peach and nectarine funkiness predominate. Nice acidic nectarine sour which is incredibly balanced. Loved this beer,4.83
Nectarine Premiere,Glad I tracked this one down! This little DG fruit bomb is loaded with Nectarine goodness and just the right amount of delightful tartness! Beautiful orange pour and refreshing as hell!,4.88
Nectarine Premiere,"Incredible pour, super hazy absolutely no transparency. bright yellow and shiny, just beautiful. The nose on this thing is stupid, my mouth gleeks with anticipation, so much juicy fruit, Nectarines are pouring out, super ripe. The blind taste test I gave to some friends had them all guessing the stone fruits immediately. The taste is nothing short of amazing, this has to be one of my very favorite from de Garde and maybe one of my all time favorite Farmhouse Ales- it's been a long time since a beer blew my expectations but this is a special bottle. I've got 2 more of these bad boys and was thinking of trading them but I might not be able to after this.",4.8

Well-balanced but heavy and sweet. Definitely a sipper with friends. Great brew.",4.34

BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),Syrupy stout with a feel that completely coats your mouth and never surrenders. It's insanely sweet and the barrel aging does little to counteract this. Was extremely excited to try this and severely let down. Not sure why it's rated so high to be honest. Almost tastes like a wine/liqueur than a beer.,3.38
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"2015 bottle. Pours motor oil thick. The thickest, blackest beer I've ever seen. Very sweet. Cola, vanilla, oak and bourbon. Dry. Super sweet. This is borderline too much. As it warms, it's getting a bit better. Yikes.",3.98
BBADL (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Big, dark, and delicious - this stands on the shoulders of the regular DL (which I have always found to be a bit of a letdown).

Haze,"Don't bogart that haze, or so the can says. I purchased the can directly from the brewery, it has a canned date of 7/2/2019 5 days prior to the date of purchase. The beer has a beautiful haze and is a thick orange yellow color. I get a slight fruity smell on the nose, very pleasant but faint. I smell peaches, and a little citrusy scent. The taste is peachy with no noticeable bitter flavors and a good amount of carbonation. The alcohol content is also well hidden in the flavor. The beer has a thick mouthfeel and is very smooth. Haze is a good representative of a New England Double IPA.",4.44
Haze,"Haze pours a murky orange juice color with a fat and inviting 2-finger head and sticky lacing retention. the smell is huge citrus dominated by stone fruits; apricot and peach, as well as an array of tropical fruits. Not a hint of alcohol on the nose and just a minor hop resin. The taste is bitter orange, peach and guava, that's smooth over the palette with a bitter prickle on the tongue and a light, lingering bitterness.",4.56
Haze,Got some cans of this from my buddy out in Boston. ,4.41
Haze,"Another outstanding NE-style IPA from this rockstar brewery. I thoroughly enjoyed this one, even though my expectations were sky high. Juicy, flavorful, creamy, well-hidden ABV and light body. Just an amazing beer. Fairly fresh, too - canned on 5/14/19. Pours a very nice hazy yellow color with lots of fluffy white head and good-looking sheets of lingering lacing that lasted for quite some time. I would have given it higher marks if the lacing or head were more impressive, but the haze looked quite good. Smells of juicy fruit - orange, tangerine, pineapple, passion fruit, grapefruit, lemon. Maybe a little mango in there. I didn't quite detect the peach. A good hit of malt, vanilla and a little caramel as well. The trailing off aromas at the end were a nice floral bouquet. The taste follows the nose, and the juiciness and depth of flavor of this beer was just so impressive. The mouthfeel was just to die for - creamy, slightly sticky, full, smooth and that high ABV was so incredibly well-hidden. Drank and felt like a regular IPA, not an imperial one. Just the right amount of carbonation. This paired well with savory dinner and even better with sweet dessert. I'm looking forward to sampling the Julius can that I own, likely tomorrow or the day after!",4.43
Haze,"Wonderfully juicy, creamy, big tropical fruit flavors, peachy, mango, nicely balanced by a minty, piney bitterness. Incredible feel, very soft, minimal lingering bitterness. Thick and hazy pale orange/yellow in the glass, lots of lacing. Drink as fresh as possible, a real treat.",4.74
Haze,Poured from a tallboy can into a Dogfish Head tulip,4.5
Haze,"Murky, pale gold beer with a big fluffy head. The nose is filled with orange, grapefruit, peach and floral hops. Beer feels light and creamy. The taste is lightly sweet and complex. There is grapefruit, orange, peach and floral components. Finishes with a nice pithy bitterness.",4.6
Haze,"This is my all-time favorite beer. It is strong in all aspects — full fine haze, hoppy & fruity nose and bursting with flavors — but has a feel that is particularly outstanding.",5
Haze,A: Pours a hazy yellow-orange color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap that leaves good lacing,4.61
Haze,Poured from a 16oz can into a Trillium IPA glass. ,4.79
Haze,"I usually give beer lofty grades by their level of complexity. This beer breaks with that tradition. It doesn't change flavors from first taste to after taste. It comes at you as one varied whole. The smell is amazing citrus, the taste brings out peach and more, with hop bitterness in perfect balance. One of the best straightforward beers I've ever had!",4.38
Haze,"Can (one off from De Bierkoning) @ home. Murky yellow (mustard) colour. Firm white head with just a little retention. Aroma's of dank hops, onion, citrus. Retronasal it's even a bit more onion-y and with a little sweetness to it. Flavour is mild, light sweet, some citrussy sourness and light bitterness. Medium bodied. Soft carbonation. Long finish with dank hops and a great burp. Lovely stuff!",4.34
Haze,Pours with a thick frothy head and has the appearance of orange-pineapple juice and tastes citrus like with a hint of pineapple in the nose. This is a fairly drinkable brew for 8.2% abv. One of my new favorites brewed on 03/05/2019,4.75
Haze,Thanks to BrutalFarce for this one. 16oz can (of course) poured into 14oz teku. Poured a solidly turbid and murky medium orange color with 1-1/2 inches of white head that had decent retention and lacing.,2.97
Haze,"Milky tan; herb oil, some pellet, slight feet, pineapple rind + grapefruit chunks; porridge, peach, some passionfruit, more oily herb leaf, melon, slight onions, Seville orange, twig + a dirty sediment hit; orange comeback, slight tartness, soft.",4.31
Haze,"It doesn't get any better.....Haze & Hurricane are like Crack to me. Super flavorful, easy to drink, high ABV doesn't show in the taste. Truly a GREAT beer that everyone who can must try.",4.69
Haze,Nice lemon color with a 2 finger head that slowly fades. Smell is of tropical fruits and grapefruit. A beautiful balance of flavors that linger on the palate well after.,4.29
Haze,"A legitimately epic NEIPA. Buries a sturdy ABV underneath a blanket of crisp citrus flavor with a spicy bite. Looks incredible in the glass with a golden hue and beautiful creamy head. While Julius remains my favorite for pure flavor, Haze is Tree House’s pinnacle among the standard offerings in my view.",4.84

Society & Solitude #4,"Society & Solitude #4 pours a thick, hazy and golden pear juice looking yellow with a big 2-finger, white and complex head, with excellent retention and lacing. The smell is juicy with a big, clean and bright citrus presence, like a tall glass of orange juice and tangerine with a hint of mango and a mild candied sweetness. The taste is excellent! Nice and smooth over the palette with a balanced citrus flavor with a mild creaminess but not overly thick. Juicy orange up front with some berry, a sweet candied melon and a grassy yet subtle dank characteristic.",4.55
Society & Solitude #4,"Look: This beer pours an opaque, hazy, golden yellow white grapefruit juice color. It does not have that murky, pond water unattractiveness that comes along with some NEIPA. No visible carbonation. A fluffy white head that sits a finger high in my stemmed wine glass, settling down to a thin layer across the top while leaving a thick blanket of lacing in its wake. ",4.52

Society & Solitude #4,2/11/19 canning date,4.42
Society & Solitude #4,"I received this from @jhavs. Canned on 10/22/2018. Poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. It has a classic NEIPA appearance: turbid, muddy-golden in color with a large foamy bright white cap and abundant, thick, lacing. The nose features lemon, tangerine, grapefruit, peach, a whiff of vanilla, and light floral hops. Wow, is this delicious! It opens rather tart with lots of lemon and grapefruit notes, balanced by sweet tangerine and other hints of tropical fruit. At the finish of the sip there is a subtle but noticeable appearance of vanilla that becomes more apparent as the glass warms and gives it a creamsicle quality. The bill of Citra and Galaxy hops is very flavorful and only slightly bitter. It finishes with a touch of pepper. The mouth feel is superb: rich and creamy with a perfect level of carbonation, and the 8% ABV provides lots of substance. Overall, I'm believing the hype. S&S #4 is sensational!",4.57

Society & Solitude #4,From growler (under 2 weeks). Bright yellow-orange completely opaque/hazy appearance with a good bit of frothy foam and carbonation upon aggressive pour. Very citrus and tropical aromaticity. Loads of citrus fruit flavors. Sweeter taste. Creamy mouthfeel and little bit of a different finish than your typical NE IPA (different from Tree House and Trillium). Hard to describe but it works well and balances the citrus fruitiness.,4.52
Society & Solitude #4,Poured from a 12 ounce can into a wine glass.,4.23
Society & Solitude #4,"First IPA from HF. Absolutely fantastic beer. Super juicy but there is a great balance of bitterness. It pours super, orange-yellow with lots of lacing. It’s creamy and delicious. Almost impossible to tell this is a double. One of the best IPAs I’ve had this year",4.65
Society & Solitude #4,7/30/18,4.57
Society & Solitude #4,Can: Poured a bright hazy yellow color ale with a nice large pure white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of fresh floral undertones notes of citrusy and light tropical notes with dank herbal notes and subtle residual sugar notes. Taste is a great mix of dank herbal nots with superb floral undertones notes of citrus and tropical fruits with right amount of residual sugar. Body is full with good carbonation. Solid IPA that I wish I could have access to on a regular basis.,4.5
Society & Solitude #4,"Thanks to jhavs for this one. canned on 3/12/18, drink by date of 4/23/18. Hmm, only good for 5 weeks? Seems sorta sketchy. 12oz can poured into 12oz tulip. Poured a solid orange color with about 1/4 inch of white head that had low retention, but good lacing.",3.75

Chocolate Rain,"This is one of the finest imperial stouts. Tastes like prunes and chocholate with not too much sweetness. It also ages really well. Mouthfeel is think, but not too thick, and the ABV is off the charts.",4.68
Chocolate Rain,"On tap at Bruery Terreux in Anaheim, CA.",4.62
Chocolate Rain,"Pours black withi a still, oily look to it. Head foams up to a finger in height, but disappears quickly. Foam is khaki in color. Aroma is booze from the moment the wax-covered bottle cap is cracked open. In addition to heavy booze (via bourbon) is chocolate, vanilla bean, toffee, molasses, coffee and roasty, toasty malts. There is a hint of char at the finish. Flavor profile follows suit, with sugary notes of chocolate, vanilla bean, toffee, molasses, caramel and brown sugar mingling with lightly bitter notes of roasty, toasty malts, coffee and char. Booze and bourbon is present throughout, adding a substantial level of heat even after aging the bottle for a couple years. Alcohol turns the finish to dry, rinsing away the initial sweetness. Mouth feel is thick and full, but with a rather still texture. Overall, heavy, filling and with plenty of heat. It's a bottle worth sharing, but sparingly. ",4.1

Chocolate Rain,"02/2015 - 2013 vintage - Wow, this is exactly what I wanted from this Black Tuesday variant; the chocolate takes it to the next level - big fan! The mouthfeel is even better, too.",4.44
Chocolate Rain,"Carbonation was a bit low with pour head retention. Not what I have seen with the other black Tuesday varients. Otherwise this is basically black Tuesday with the chocolate notes turned up to 11, which is not a bad thing.",4.49
Chocolate Rain,"Pouring a 2017 bottle from a 750 ml. bottle into a tulip glass. This beer, just like Black Tuesday, pours out way lighter in color than expected when pouring a stout of this nature. Medium-dark brown color with highlights all the way through. On the pour, as quick as bubbles could form they would pop. Eventually the carbonation got ahead of the disippation and formed a thinner light tan crown. The smell is quite demanding and confident with booze and alcohol. It burns the nostrils and honestly doesn't leave much else to show you along the way. The taste comes in more inviting, showing you smooth chocolate and vanilla, while still having a rather pronounced burn. I do enjoy the thickness of the body to these but I will say that I wish this and Black Tuesday were both more complex. They really aren't blowing me away. I get it, it's impressive they made a 20% stout blah blah blah, but I still want it to have complexity and blow me away. And these just haven't been.",3.69

Chocolate Rain,"Over the last year, I have had pours of the 2012, 2013, 2016 and 2017 batches. This beer ages phenomenally, love the chocolate aromas and taste. Will continue to buy and drink this lovely beer.",4.85
Chocolate Rain,"Mixed opinion. Have been waiting to try this for years. Bought 3 and will try out over at least 9 Years. Beer #1: Beer had outstanding nose and flavor, and is easily considered an excellent beer. Appearance was fine and head/lacing consistent with an almost 20% ABV. Very disappointed in mouthfeel... had expected something full and rich and instead a bit hot (understand), very thin (don’t understand) and even a touch astringent. Hard to believe it’s a Double IS. Almost a mix of Black Tuesday, Vanilla, nibs... and Sang Noir.",4.44

Chocolate Rain,"Tasted from bottle. Pours dark brown/black with minimal head. Aroma is dark chocolate and vanilla. Moderate bitterness with alcohol burn on the finish. Flavors of cacao and vanilla, bourbon, toffee, caramel and maple. Huge beer and very dangerous.",4.04
Chocolate Rain,"Clear mahogany with red edges and a fuzzy tan head that fizzles out quickly to a thin ring at first, then to nothing at all, ending up like glass of dark rum--the surface appears sticky and slick, and a swirl leaves clear legs on the glass. Those legs stay damn near permanently which I don't think I've ever seen in a beer before today.",3.96
Chocolate Rain,"Just too boozy. Had a 2014 and it was still too hot. I mean you get tons of chocolate it's dark as night and it's thick, but it's booze followed by chocolate. Tough to have more then a 5oz. pour.",3.81
Chocolate Rain,Typical big Bruery beer look. Little head that goes away fast. But at 19% what do you expect. Big chocolate smell and bourbon. Taste is fudge with some alcohol bite at the end. Feel is slightly thin. But that's how all these weekday stouts are so it's expected. Amazing overall beer from one of the top brueries to do the big stout.,4.64
Chocolate Rain,"A: Chocolate aroma upfront, boozy, with lots of vanilla character, followed by a moderate oak and bourbon presence.",4.34
Chocolate Rain,"This was an interesting beer for sure. Opened a fresh 2017. Had a dark amber color. Aroma was chocolate and boozy with some sweetness. Flavor was still a little hot from the abv but still delicious. Lots of bourbon, chocolate and some vanilla. Drank a little lighter Thani expected. Overall really enjoyable.",4.41

Chocolate Rain,2017 version.,4.6
Beatification,Bottle pour at the 2019 Festival of Farmhouse Ales. This one absolutely lived up the hype. Perfectly balanced. The best sour beer I've had from Russian River and that is saying something.,4.75
Beatification,"At last got my hands on this RR classic! Golden orange with no head save a clear ring. Wonderful aromas of oak, wet earth, lemon, grass, hay, grapefruit zest, barrel must, and grains. Taste is more acidic and vinegar forward, but has all the same flavors from the smell, with an ending backed by sour oak and plenty of funk, but also leaves the palate pretty citrus sweet. Not the most complex, but plenty flavorful. Feel is tart, funky and has a vinegar artful harshness.",4.49
Beatification,Look - very high carbonation and a clear pale yellow/straw color - stays quite active. Smell - decent amount of funk from 'spontaneous fermentation' - slight vinegar hint. Taste - pretty powerful blast of sourness and tart fruit - slight yeast and bread - some malt - mostly sour but backs off and other flavors come through then. Feel - medium bodied (which is a bit fuller than a typical barrel aged sour) and stays at a higher level of carbonation than expected. Overall - this is a great beer - I picked up this bottle in the original R.R. tap room in March 2019 - not as sour as I expected with a spontaneous fermented beer - a bit more complexity in this one as well - very enjoyable,4.25
Beatification,"Got a bottle of this in July of 2017 when my best friend Jon and I visited the brewery when I went to visit him in northern California where he lives. This particular bottle was bottled on 2/15/17. Been holding onto this until tonight. Decided tonight is the night to finally drink this one. Poured out the bottle I just uncorked into my tulip glass, this beer pours a fairly cloudy/hazy light golden color with a good amount of little bubbles rising to the beer's surface. Has a nice white head that's about an inch thick when first poured that settles eventually to a medium sized ring lining the inside of the glass. Not much lacing here though. Aromas of some bready malts along with sour, musty, barnyard funk and oak notes along with a hint of citrus fruit. The taste follows suit, with some bready malts along with sour, musty, barnyard funk and oak notes along with a hint of citrus fruit and some green apple tartness. A very nice flavor profile overall indeed. Has a fairly crisp and slightly prickly, yet also smooth, medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish with a nice sour and slightly dry aftertaste. Very easy to drink in teh way well crafted beer ought to be.",4.3
Beatification,Pours a mostly clear straw yellow with a thin white head that disappeared quickly.,4.49

Beatification,"Appearance - The poured the color of apple juice with visible carbonation, but little head. ",4.23
Beatification,"I received this from @bum4ever in a BIF box. It was a ""mystery"" beer and my initial notes were made without knowing its identity. Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. It pours a slightly hazy bright gold with orange hues. The effervescent, ecru-colored head dissipated quickly giving it a champagne-like appearance. It has the unmistakable smell of brett yeast, along with lemon and perhaps a hint of lime. There is also a distinct smell of oak. It's very fragrant. As expected, the taste opens strongly sour with bitter lemon notes. There is also a subtle taste of grape that gives it a small amount of balancing sweetness. As the glass warms you can increasingly taste the oak barrel and it finishes fairly bitter. The flavors blend very well. As expected for a Wild Ale, the feel is crisp and light with lively carbonation, and the 6% ABV doesn't distract from appreciation of the flavors. Overall, this is by far one of the finest Wild Ales I've had the pleasure to drink. Thank you, Josh, for the opportunity.",4.49
Beatification,"2018 edition, poured into a tulip. A clear bright golden color with a modest white head that quickly settled. Crisp citrus aroma - lemon and orange. Some Brett funky esters and dough as well. The taste was phenomenal. Juicy citrus notes mixed with grassy, funky elements, doughy bread, and earthy elements. Moderately tart and very drinkable. The cherry on top was the elegant oaky presence throughout. Not overwhelming, but enough to easily notice. Exceptional.",4.49
Beatification,"2017 vintage. Poured from fridge temp and allowed to warm. Pours a beautiful yellow with quickly dissipating white head. No sediment in the bottle. Nose is insane. A huge burst of citrus smacks you in the face. Lemon and orange primarily. A bit of pine, wheat, funk, and tartness. I can tell that this is going to be sour. Taste is as expected. Sour upfront, with a bitterness on the back end. Citrus peel really comes through, with a really nice earthy taste that runs throughout. Pine and a bit of leather are present. Mouthfeel is dry with good carbonation. Overall, a really nice example of the style. They always compete with the best.",4.38
Beatification,"Pouring from a 375 ml. bottle into a tall wine glass. Bottle dated 3/01/18. This beer pours out light straw/lemon in color. And forms a thick white crown. The smell is some fruit sweetness and tartness. Peaches, apples, pears. The taste is sharp and ripe fruit and a slight funk. Almost has a burning like tartness. I am just really not coming out impressed with these Russian Rivers I have tried. I wish I was but it's just not adding up to me. I've had better sours than this. I want more complexity, more flavor. Idk just not adding up to me the ratings.",3.83
Beatification,Tasted from bottle batch 7. Pours a slight cloudy gold with no head. Lot of oak notes along with wine notes. A little bit of sour funk. Taste refreshing mildly sour funky refreshing beer. Some grassy notes along with grapes and maybe a little peach. Very well done.,4.31

Beatification,"Sparkling vibrant gold with a large, airy off-white foam disappearing into a shimmering, lightly bubbling surface.",4.09
Beatification,"Bottled 021517. Clear yellow appearance with a good bit of foam upon pour. Foam and bubbles are similar to that of sparkling wine. Lemony, with a bit of a barnyard funk aroma and flavor. Not overly acidic/aggressive as some of the other RR sours. Oakiness does come out as it warms. Smooth and crisp at the end. ",4.44
Beatification,"Bottle 2-17 consumed 3-18. Pours a hazy medium yellow color with notes of peach. Thin white head that is short lasting. Nose is of apple and grape skin, light funk and wet oak. Taste of apple skin, grape must with hints of damp wood and a light mellow yogurt smoothness. Pasture grass after a rain storm and a ever so slight clove like flair that leaves as fast as it appeared. Medium body with ample carbonation given the bc. Dry semi smooth oak finish.",4.58
Beatification,"Poured a 2015 Beatification on New Years .. Gotta love the cork pop you get. Poured a hazy yellow with a tinge of orange. Smell is that of what I imagine a great sour should smell. The tart, the oak, the nice funk really shines on this beer. Reminds me a lot of some of the best Jester King has to offer. Wow overall this a fantastic beer and if you are lucky enough to acquire one of these great beers, know that you have a good turn of luck. Cheers !",4.72
Beatification,"Back when I first started trading and was still knee deep in my ""ticking phase"" of craft beer tutelage, Beatification was probably one of the biggest white whales on the planet, second only to the magnum version of itself.",4.24

Beatification,Light straw cloudy color with plenty of carbination and white head that desipates quickly. Mild citrus aroma. Taste is a pleasant tart citrus with a little bite as it goes down.,4.1
Beatification,"Pours a transluscent pale orange with champagne like carbonation. Smells of apple juicy, slightly reminiscent of vinegar. Taste is powerfully sour, fruity and mostly easy drinking. Mouthfeel is somewhat harsh despite this bottle being nearly 5 years old. Hasn't mellowed out too much. Still, enjoyed it.",3.74
Beatification,Bottle at the ol' source. Been waiting to try this for ages. Very hazy. No head. Very sour smelling and tasting. Noticeable dry wine character. Lingering yet punctual flavor. Not surprised this is a highly regarded brew. I learned about sours through the -ation series from Russian River. Maybe the sheen has worn off just a but but this was still a well prescribed notch in the belt.,4.4
Beer:Barrel:Time,"B2. About as perfect of a BA stout as you can get. Barrel hits your nose as soon as you pop the bottle. Although there are no adjuncts, you pick up massive notes of fudge and vanilla in the taste. Barrel is very present but doesn't overwhelm the other flavors. Feel is the best I've had in a stout....thick, moderately low carbonation, coats the tongue, with no burn. Fantastic.",5

Beer:Barrel:Time,"I had B1. Split with 4 ppl. Probably about 6oz. An excellent stout without question; roasty and formidable. Coating mouthfeel, and a unique burnt sugar quality. Creme brûlée slightly. Would love to try B2",4.78
Beer:Barrel:Time,"I honestly didn't love this beer as much as I had expected. While the appearance and mouthfeel were fantastic, I thought the beer itself tasted overly smokey. It was certainly a beer worth trying, but I'd never advise someone to chase it given what it fetches on the secondary market. Proceed with caution.",4.33
Beer:Barrel:Time,I'm glad I had a chance to obtain this before the value really took off on this. Quite a delight without the adjuncts that are popular these days. Body and barrel were fantastic.,4.88
Beer:Barrel:Time,"Batch 1 was boozier than batch 2, batch 2 had some chocolate flavors that batch 1 didn't seem to have, both are excellent, but preference to batch 2. Side by side tasting. B1 = 4.67 B2 = 4.83",4.8
Beer:Barrel:Time,"Pours of b1 and b2 during the 2nd Anniversary Party at the brewery. Pours like used motor oil with little to no head. Rich and malty on the nose, and the flavor comes across as balanced. Not overly sweet, with enough balance of the barrel and malt for both flavors to present themselves on the palate. I probably would rate these higher, had I not been drinking various Derivations at the same time.",4.56
Beer:Barrel:Time,"Chocolate, toffee, and molasses on the palate. Bourbon rich and thick with a well-integrated barrel quality. Overall, a very balanced and well executed barrel aged stout.",4.75

Beer:Barrel:Time,BBT b2 on site at The Cellar.,5
Beer:Barrel:Time,"Saved this one for beer #6,000. Great decision on my part if I do say so. This is an incredibly rich and complex stout, with layer of luxurious depth. Fudge, vanilla, molasses, roasted nuts, coffee, oak, caramel, and of course a healthy smattering of bourbon. Smell not as smoky or deep as taste, more focused on chocolate, vanilla, and barrel, but otherwise twins. Body is so textured and varied I can chew on it, even with booze burst at finish. Truly a special beer",4.69
Beer:Barrel:Time,"So awesome to try! Awesome molasses, light tobacco, big malts, a touch of vanilla and roast up front; superb, luscious, chewy body that lingers; creamy flavors with barrel that lasts; a superb sipper.",4.78
Beer:Barrel:Time,"Amazing barrel forward stout. Smells like vanilla wafers and charred oak and dark caramel. Baffling complexity combined with sufficient sweetness. And while the booze is currently still fairly intense, I can see this aging beautifully. Mouthfeel was full but as usual is the case in any non-TG beer, I wouldn't have minded a bit more substance there. Altogether of the best barrel aged beers I've ever tasted and perhaps (surprisingly) i enjoyed it even more than any of the Derivations I've had.",4.69
Beer:Barrel:Time,This beer is boozy chocolate perfection. Cory nailed the barrel on this recipe and has produced an incredible beer. Thick and fudgy but with restraint. I was able to drink this bottle by myself throughout the evening and didn't regret it.,5
Beer:Barrel:Time,"750 mL bottle. Inky black body. Smells of strong whiskey, nutty and oaky character, and almost soy sauce malt aroma. Tastes of fudge and chocolate. Creamy and chocolatey. Whiskey kicks in with strong oak and it dries out with a boozy finish. Aftertaste is just shy of soy sauce again. Heavy and slow to drink. It's very good. I say that begrudgingly.",3.98

Beer:Barrel:Time,"Stark black with a thin, burnt yellowish-tan ring.",3.5
Beer:Barrel:Time,"750ml bottle of the 2017 release. Served in a Side Project stemmed glass. Pour is a massively dark black body, one finger offwhite head, fair retention and no lacing as expected. Smell is rich. Really rich chocolate fudge, light smoke and bourbon, a lot of wet oak barrel and even a bit of vanillin, cocoa nibs, perhaps a little bit of espresso, sugar. It smells appropriately sweet. Flavour is a revelation; incredibly complex flavour profile of vanillin, oak, chocolate, cocoa, bourbon, slight char and smoke. This hits all the notes and very well it should. It's not particularly boozy, but the bourbon flavours just do so well in integrating with the stout. It's sweet, but doesn't taste sickly sweet. Mouthfeel is full bodied, substantial in body with a nice appropriate carbonation to it that is just enough without being overly prickly or flat. Tons of flavours from the beginning to the end, an easy one to ponder and sip on as it seems to change so much as it warms. There is a lot of hype behind this beer, and deservedly so. This checked off everything I could ever want in a non-adjunct, bourbon barrel-aged imperial stout.",4.65
Beer:Barrel:Time,"It poured a super thick and viscous in the glass, pitch black color with very little head. Very little carbonation. The smell is sweet with tons of fudge interlace with bourbon and oak. Not complex by any means but so balance, sweet and rich. The flavor profile is just the same - so much rich chocolate fudge in the mouth balanced out with the warming touch of bourbon. Its sweet with a lot of depth that includes dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, and bourbon; all the things you would dream of in a barrel aged stout. The mouthfeel is thick and rich without much warmth for a 15% ABV beer. Overall: this is a superb beer, well remarkable for its balance of flavors, its depth of flavors and the thickness. Some may say its overrated because its not too different from other easy to obtain stouts. I have to disagree, it is well perfected with its sweetness, balance and the bourbon.",4.69

Beer:Barrel:Time,"its amazing to have a stout this rich and complex and decadent without any adjuncts, a defiant statement here to the countless triple coconut belgian chocolate chili pepper cinnamon vanilla bean whatevers out there, nothing to hide here, no need for extras. i know this is the base for all the coffee variants, and after having this i really want to try some of them, but there is no need for coffee here, there is no need for anything. at a certain size threshold, and 15% abv certainly qualifies, something happens in big stouts like this where they either become exposed and sloppy and kitchen sinky and off putting, or they become the stuff of legend. this is without a doubt in the latter camp, one of the smoothest, richest, and most complete barrel aged stouts out there right now. the barrels are obviously special, but thats not what makes the beer for me, as much as the old oak and the mature whiskey are fine compliments to this. what makes it for me is the layers of grain and the overall density of this. it seriously has the consistency of brownie batter, and what the pale malts, sweeter crustal types, and starchy oats add to the dark roasty barley is special, displays elite level understanding, and makes this memorable from a quality standpoint. i love the slick heavy feel, motor oil going down, heavy roast already with some coffee character, but drenched in quality bourbon and vanilla, brown sugar, and molasses. i like this warm, and i like the warming alcohol that slowly drifts up front it. chewy feeling but still carbonated. absolutely expert beer, i hope to get to try the coffee editions, but this is special as it is. a new high bar for barrel aged stout!",4.53

Oude Geuze Vintage,"Enjoyed much more than I expected to. I'm one of those rare people who's not in love with the standard Oude Geuze, but found this to be much more approachable. That being said, I'd take the Golden Blend over this in a heartbeat.",4.17
Oude Geuze Vintage,"2012 version, at Lambik-o-droom. Slightly hazy dark golden color with creamy beige head. Aroma starts with hay, dry meadow flowers, unripe stonefruits and some lemon. Taste starts tart upfront with unripe fruits, but also with a fruit pits, seeds and skin bitterness. Hay and farmhouse notes throughout, funky but not too extreme. Light to medium body, dry, light to medium carbonation. A really well rounded gueuze, sour but quite easy to drink, funky but not cloying.",4.5
Oude Geuze Vintage,"Replaced my 05 review with a 2012 review, because 2012 was better. It is what I imagined the perfect gueze would taste like. Seriously. Perfection of beer. 5s across the board, for my 1st time ever.",5
Oude Geuze Vintage,"From a 2012 bottle - A little bit of tart and bitter lemon rind, mineral qualities, and heavy funk that comes across like raw leather. Oak barrel brings a bit of sweetness, balancing the other flavors. The combination of tart, bitter, funk, and oak for this particular beer was great; one of the best beers I've had yet.",4.9

Maman,"Had a few on draft tonight, which was nice. If you're waiting for the bcbs comparison, wait no longer. This is much more approachable because it finishes drier and meanders through more dark fruits en route. Think a lighter, more carbonated d3, etc. omg. mfd(oom). gimb.",4.44

Maman,"Supremely good stout...having tasted the BA Abraxas, the similarities are extremely apparent. Density is very similar, with a deep brown color and rich mouthfeel. Potentially a dumb comment, but strip out the adjuncts of BAA and you have all the gorgeousness of Maman. I think it speaks volumes that the Maman core stands up within the BAA product. Essentially, if you want something very close to BAA without ""distractions"" (albeit extremely good ones), this is your beer. This is a beer that BEGS you to take more sips...very, very sessionable. Bit of a raisin edge to an impressively structured beer.",4.71
Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"A killer bottle that is the furthest thing from the pervasive hazy IPAs and pastry stouts.

Medium full body, semi sticky feel; lite carbonation; slightly warming; smooth, silky tongue coating; dry oaky barrel finish.

Might be the best nose of any beer on the planet. Huge toffee and bourbon. Plums and figs. All of the notes are so pronounced. Nothing is being held back on this beer, which isn't surprising given the 13.5% ABV. Also picking up some yeast, vanilla, black currant, and sweet candy. I just can't stop smelling this beer! Taste is out of this world. Huge caramel smacks you in the face immediately upon sipping. Alcohol burns slightly on the back end. In the middle, there is a complex interaction between dark fruit (blackberries, currant, figs, cherries), bourbon, and nutty/bread flavors. I am just amazed by this beer. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, viscous, and chewy. Coats the mouth and lingers for a long time. Overall, one of the best beers I have tasted. I hope to find another one at some point in the future.",4.96

Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"From the start you know what this beer is all about. Immediately you get tons of caramel and dark fruit, very sweet on the nose.

I love the label on this beer a black label with dark purple, way cool. The beer is 47 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The gentle pour produced a two finger bright white head. The head is creamy and airy with good retention. Lacing was left on the glass as it slowly dissipated. The color of the beer is SRM 6 a deep gold with amber hues. Clarity of the beer is hazy from the yeast. Overall, a solid appearance for this beer. ",4.63
Doppelganger,look: like peach orange juice with pulp I imagine. Sudsy plush head on the pour that mostly recedes.,4.34
Doppelganger,Had a can thanks to Shawn. Overall Very good well crafted. Thought the tropical fruit tones were muted but complex and delicious. Very soft easy mouthfeel for a canned beer.,4.44
Doppelganger,Reminds me a lot of other New England double IPA. The greatness of this beer is the piney smell as well as the hoppiness and long aftertaste. Reminds me of Heady Topper.,4.38
Doppelganger,"Thanks to jlindros for hooking this up (and a bunch of other beers). Pours a hazy yellow with 1/3"" white head on the top. Aroma was citrus, didn't pop tropical fruit on this one, just seemed like a hearty dose of Citra hops and maybe just a drop of stone fruit aroma. Doesn't seem to be dry hopped any bigger or better than the big boys out here (Monkish/Cellarmaker/Moonraker/Alvarado/Revision) that make comparable stuff. ",4.18

Ephraim,"Beautiful turbid orange appearance with a little white head. Smell of pine, orange, other citrus - hops. Very warm and spicy for a HF IPA. Taste follows the nose with a smack of pine, citrus, and bitterness. Leaves behind a slight bready taste. Feel is superb for a 10% beer. Slightly chewey and so refreshing. Overall, this is a great IPA that is reminiscent of Pliny, but has the color and some of the nose and taste of a NEIPA",4.49

Ephraim,"""Best consumed by 7/13/17""; drank 7/16/17 (I did my best). ",4.25
Ephraim,"First time trying Ephraim, poured from growler 1 day after being filled into tulip glass. Opaque hazy golden color, decent head, retention, and lacing. Tropical fruity nose and taste, and smooth full mouth feel. Easily in the same league as Abner, Susan, and SS 4&5. Outstanding!",4.78
Ephraim,"This was poured into a snifter. The appearance was a semi-hazy almost burnt orange color with a thin wisp of a white head that quickly dissipated. Light bubbles of broken head float around the top. Light wispy lacing. The smell takes in sweet danky onion sliding on into through resinous pine and then a light grapefruit underneath. The taste had a full bittersweet flavor revolving around the resinous piney part. Dry resinous aftertaste leads into a dry finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body. ABV, whoah, where did that go? Its not really there, well hidden. Overall, wow, just wow, just an absolutely stellar job by HF. I’d love to have this again.",4.71
Ephraim,This was malty for my tastes and for most HF hoppy beers. Felt more like a west cost IPA with the malt and pine characteristics. One of my least favorite HF hoppy beers.,4
Ephraim,"Very creamy IPA. Nice hops golden color, hoppy, piney and floral smells coming off one this one. Hazy orange color. Love the light creamy fluffy feel on this one.",4.76
Ephraim,"This one struck me as a little bitter at first, but I ended up really enjoying it as I went on. The combination of hops in this one works very well, making it another solid DIPA from HF.",4.52
Ephraim,"I don't generally love hoppy beers that are over 8.5% because they're too heavy and sweet, and this one is just those things. Hill beers have unrivaled mouthfeel and elegance, and this is just overdone. Intended I'm sure, given that it's 10%, but I'd take most of the Hill single and double IPAs over Ephraim.",4.12
Ephraim,Poured from a 750 growler into a snifter. Thanks Rich for hooking me up with this.,4.03
Ephraim,"L: Clear amber, white head to a ring. It's fine, but not what I love.",4.36
Ephraim,"Sampled pour from a fresh 32 oz growler That indicated Amarillo hops were highlighted. Pours bRight, nearly lemon yellow and slightly hazy with a solid 2 fingers of dense head. Nose is lemongrass combined with grapefruit and a hint of bubblegum sweetness. The taste presented the sweet fruitiness apparent on the nose but was beautifully balanced by resinous hop bitterness. This is definitely one of the best IPAs I've had the pleasure of tasting.",4.85
Ephraim,"Expecting a bit more from this one. I expected the booziness given the 10% ABV but seem to be lacking in the aroma department. I enjoyed Abner earlier this week much more. Nonetheless, this is still a great beer. HF continues to produce high quality beers.",4.23
Ephraim,"Big, beefy DIPA with a huge ABV that drinks incredibly easy. Hoppy, piney and floral aroma; taste of orange rind, mandarin orange, mango, apricot, grapefruit, tobacco and green tea. Outstanding citrus and bitter profile with a soft mouthfeel, but it's not a balanced beer - it's a big time hop-forward DIPA that comes on strong and doesn't let up. With a 10% ABV I'm not sure what else you could expect. Prepare your face. They've employed magic to make such a huge beer so palatable.",4.28
Ephraim,"So. Damned. Creamy. The dextrose bumps up the body but doesn't make it syrupy. The appearance is pretty much perfect; bright auburn, perfect carbonation, sticky lacing. Pine resin and grapefruit dominate the taste and aroma. Maybe some tangelo and sweeter citrus. Though far from my favorite HF hoppy beer, it's ne of the best triple IPAs I've had. My heart still belongs to Notorious though.",4.42
Ephraim,"The beer comes in a pale amber, medium haze.",4.03
Ephraim,Loved his brew! Waited forever to track it down but was able to sue to solid trading partners!!! :). Shared from a fresh 750 with friends. Excellent beer and tons of hops! Still pretty smooth but you can tell the abv is rather high,4.9
Ephraim,"The hallmark of HF beers is restraint, sophistication and a flawless execution. Ephraim is a bit peculiar by this standard. It is a bit too boozy, bitter and big. Distinctly lacking in those great tropical fruit/floral notes that the best HF hoppy beers have. I suspect another reason this is slightly disappointing is that the IPA game has consistently upped the bar since Ephraim stepped on the scene. Not a bad beer, but also not up to the considerable hype either.",4
Ephraim,Poured from a growler filled on 2/13/16 into a Hill Farmstead stem glass.,3.85
Chemtrailmix,"Had this both fresh and ""aged"" for what it is worth, and I will say that the strength of the cinnamon itself does die down a little given time. But even with time, this is a cinnabomb, and as my favorite adjunct in a stout, take the rating with a little sense of bias. The cinnamon hides/tones down a bit of the sweetness of the overall brew, yet seems to be enhanced in flavor. A great addition to the BA DL family.",5
Chemtrailmix,"I've had the pleasure of enjoying Chemtrailmix three years in a row now - the bourbon barrel variant in 2017 stands out to me the most as it doesn't have the same bite and spice of rye (which I also happen to love). With a bit of age, the peppercorns mellow just slightly and the bourbon smoothly shines through. Back to back with barrel-aged Abraxas, this is still a tough one to beat. The cinnamon is far less present though, and those peppercorns have more of a bite.",4.7
Chemtrailmix,"Tasted from bottle. Pours black with minimal beige head. Lots of spices on aroma. Vanilla, cinnamon, bourbon. Taste is moderate to heavily sweet but not as much as regular dark lord. Nice cinnamon flavor and thankfully not a cinnamon bomb. Flavors of vanilla, cocoa, coffee, caramel, molasses and a hint of peppercorn on the finish. Awesome beer.",5
Chemtrailmix,"by far the best beer with cinnamon I've ever had. Very thick, this was Batch 1 that I had. It was really well balanced, cinnamon wasn't overpowering.",4.84
Chemtrailmix,"Had on tap at DLD. At a glance this looks like most other DL with a dark chocolate brown with a small head. The smell is dark chocolate and cinnamon toast crunch. When you take a sip the, the cinnamon plays perfectly with the dark chocolate and cocoa aspects of the Dark Lord. There is a slight heat and spice on the backend that lingers. Overall, this is one of the best variants of Dark Lord I've had in awhile and get why people hope to get this bottle!",4.95
Chemtrailmix,Appearance - The beer poured dark color with a creamy mocha head topping off the pour. ,5
Chemtrailmix,"11/17/18 (Chicago): 2 oz 15.0% ABV pour at 2018 FOBAB into taster glass. Dark brown pour, puffy tan head, leaves nice lacing, very good looking pour. Balanced aroma, chocolate the most prevalent with a hint of cinnamon. Malt has light roasted coffee aroma, rye whiskey well masked. Exciting bold taste, chocolate, cinnamon and very smooth rye whiskey worked great, very balanced offering. Nice creamy smooth mouth feel. This was a great offering, glad I had a chance to sample my first Dark Lord, this variant is an excellent offering and I look forward to trying future Dark Lord offerings.",4.38
Chemtrailmix,L: Dark mocha and chestnut hues with a rust-colored head and ample lacing,4.74
Chemtrailmix,One of the best beers of the year. This balances out perfectly the cinnamon and peppercorns with the barrel and the stout. A really really special beer that I’m very glad to have tried and have more of,4.75
Chemtrailmix,Multiple pours via tap DLD,4.75
Chemtrailmix,"This glass of used motor oil on draft has brown staining legs in spades and a lesser mocha fizz than its un-spiced, un-aged younger brothers.",4.69
Chemtrailmix,Had on tap at Dark Lord Day 18.,4.55
Chemtrailmix,Draft at DLD and on draft 2 days later at FFF.,4.99
Chemtrailmix,"I had FIVE of the variants on DLD and this was by far the best. The taste is a mild cinnamon toast crunch with a great balance of the peppercorns. This is a world class stout, very silky. If you can get it, get it.",4.94
Chemtrailmix,This beer was amazing. I sampled 6 of the Dark Lord variants including Marshmallow Handjee and French Vanilla Malitia. It was the best by far. Personally it stole the show at Dark Lord Day. It was even better than the 2017 version.,4.96
Chemtrailmix,"First beer I had at Dark Lord Day 2018. Sampled multiple times throughout the course of the day as well. On draft and poured into plastic cups, which were then poured into my glass. Standard Dark Lord body, not much to be said about that. Smell is a massive cinnamon, slight spicy rye, brown sugar, a bit of burnt black coffee, a bit of umami, milk chocolate- recognizably Dark Lord underneath. The flavour is a bit more muddled, but the cinnamon remains huge, from the beginning to the end, contributing that cinnamon toasted crunch up front intermingling with the DL base, and combining well with the spicy rye barrel to bring more of a spice component on the backend. Peppercorns aren't as prominent as in 2017, which is a good thing. Mouthfeel is full bodied, good carbonation, smooth and slightly silky, cinnamon spice on the finish. This is on the level of BA Abraxas in terms of the cinnamon, without the green pepper from the spices. I can see this one being the variant of the year.",4.61
Chemtrailmix,"absolutely phenomenal, surprisingly great balance of rye barrel notes with cinnamon and the pick peppercorn worked well into the mix. Rich and full. Outstanding indeed.",4.94

Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,"Nose is pineapples, candied tangerine, pine. Taste follows with pithy tangerine with some pineapple and then finishes like biting into a juicy tangerine.

Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,"Probably the best DDH NEIPA I have tried to date, and although I may not have tried everything under the sun that still includes quite a bit of the best!! So incredibly well-balanced, amazing smell and perfect feel and finish. Bought in Boston and drank fresh.",4.96
Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,"finally got my lips on this one, an extra hopped version of their now famous pale ale, and its predictably awesome. the thing about this, and about so many of the dry hoppy trillium beers really, is that they seem to know when to stop, and in some ways, i like this as much for what it isnt as i do for what it is. its not green and vegetal and forced, over saturated, harsh, or bitey, and that alone makes it better than so many others out there in this style right now. soft yellow even light greenish in color, its muted looking, thin, and nicely bubbly. it smells awesome, citra all over this, but not modern day citra, like citra when it first came into vogue and nobody could get enough of it, so distinctive and fresh, lemony and lemongrassy, with a beautiful freshness to it that almost is as relevant as the aroma it contributes. light green tea, a softly starchy but dry grain base, and a level of refinement evident that i am not used to in these. the flavor is as good as the nose, pineapple and honeydew and lemon zest all come to mind, but this isnt intense for all the dry hops it has, they seem so well integrated, not just on the surface but fundamental to what this is, and that is rare. light bitterness at the end but enough for this to appear balanced. awesome carbonation makes it feel really light, and the grain base is dry and simple but rustic enough to contribute something, and i really like that with the juicy hops in here. a really worthy beer, highly acclaimed and for good reason.",4.44
Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,Truly excellent well balanced and smooth double dry hopped pale ale. Salad hands of Citra with fruit flavors as well. Great aroma. Extremely well balanced beer and drink at 6.6%.,4.73
Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,"I'm a huge fan of Trillium's higher gravity DIPAs and wasn't sure what to expect with a Pale Ale DDH, but I am very impressed. Great nose and look, very juicy in flavor and scent. The mouth feel is very light compared to their larger ABV offerings, but it bursts with flavor through to the end of the glass. A great beer at an attractive price point!",4.74

Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,"World-class indeed! Beautiful complexity, a flavor dance both juicy and bitter. Gorgeous hazy look in the glass, a grapefruit smell the second you pop the top. An eye-closer on every sip.",4.54
Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,"Smell: This is an attack of Pineapple right away. Pineapple juice, fresh pineapple. After all the pineapple more tropical fruit comes along. It is reminiscent of a tropical stone fruit cocktail. Mango, papaya, peach, pear. It’s has like a liquified sugary syrup note that really helps hammer home that canned fruit cocktail thing. A touch of really sweet juicy mandarin oranges. Also a really bright note of zesty grapefruit and white bread crust. The beer smells ridiculously good!",4.43
Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,A - Pours a turbid orange with a one finger fizzy white head. Nice amount of soay lacing.,4.52

Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,"I don’t often rate beers, actually I never rate beers, but I felt I had to for this beer. I love everything about it. Taste, smell, look and even the price isn’t bad (so long as you get it from their brewery and not a second hand liquor store on the west coast). I’ve had a lot of beers in my 8 years of craft drinking and this ranks near the top of not the very top of my list of all time beers. If my sisters didn’t already live in Boston I’d consider flying back east just for this beer.",5
Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,Thanks goes out to colby600 for this brew.,4.71
Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,"Hazy Orange color at the pour, with a large head that is fairly thin. Smell is amazing - you could smell this beer across the room at open. Taste is pineapple with a nice hop bite at the end. Creamy body that fits the beer nicely. I'd say it's my favorite APA I've except for maybe DDH PseudoSue, though at 6.6% this is an APA in name only.",4.69
Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,"16oz can purchased at the brewery dated 11/13/17. A very cloudy orange color and a citrus/hoppy nose. Complex citrus flavors include grapefruit, melon, pineapple and mango. A relatively easy-drinking, flavorful and enjoyable beer. Maybe the best we've had from Trillium.",4.62

Triple Sunshine,"12 oz can canned 9/9/19 poured into a tulip glass, a golden hazy orange with half finger white head. Aroma is all pine,grapefruit, and maybe some cantaloupe? The taste is very balanced between some malt/sugar notes and the hop citrus flavor profile. The alcohol is barely noticeable. Mouthfeel is medium heavy, carbonation level is medium low. A pretty tasty balanced triple.",4.46
Triple Sunshine,"Canned on: 08/09/19, picked up at the new brewery.",4.77
Triple Sunshine,"12 oz can: This one pours a hazy darker orangish golden color. A wisp of a white head and almost no lacing. Good nose. Resinous pine, citrus and tropical hop notes. The taste is very good. Somewhat bitter with an underlying thicker sweetness. Resinous pine, citrus and tropical flavors. Maybe some honey and biscuit also. Very nice.",4.43
Triple Sunshine,"Probably the best/smoothest of the triple IPAs that I’ve had. With that said, the style itself is a bit over the top for my preference. The booze overpowers everything else. Some flavors of overripe peaches and white grapefruit but the booze washes over everything and lingers. Some residual sweetness with the boozy aftertaste. Overall probably the top of the class for this style but the style isn’t my preference.",3.85
Triple Sunshine,LAWSONS TRIPLE SUNSHINE TIPA 5/30/19,4.74
Triple Sunshine,"Canned 3/27/19. Pours a mild golden hue with a thin head into my glass. Strong hop punch in the nose with pineapple and grapefruit. Extremely bitter with grapefruit, pineapple and lychee making their presence known in the mouth. Acidic finish that reminds one to sip, not quaff. At 10.3%, it's stronger than most IPAs and if you like your IPAs on the lower side of the spectrum, you may not enjoy this. I do though. Well worth it.",3.96

Triple Sunshine,Brother in law traversing Vermont happened upon Lawson Finest ( I gave him a hint). He rewarded me with triple sunshine,4.24
Triple Sunshine,"This beer is amazingly good..It poured unassumingly into my goblet. And I smelled the fragrant moistness of a hop plant, and I could feel it growing, into the sun, for me to have come in contact with my taste receptors on my tongue, which then shot the image into my brain...I even felt the warmth of the sun's rays onto the hop plant that I had seen come on a journey through the loving brewing processes of Lawson's Liquids, making with humble and tender care to get these impressions upon my tongue, which can talk but not hear, and my eyes, which can see but don't know how the see, to the mind's eye, seeing the journey of the hops into the fingers that type this review. I have to say...this beer really took me on a journey on what it means to be a hop plant, a miracle of the bosom of this earth, which loves all of it's subjective observers, whom we are but a small portion of. You try that with any other beer and you're going to have much more difficult time. This beer is what it means to be a hop...this is WHY hops are what they are!",4.83
Triple Sunshine,"Ironically, it's Lawson's that is helping me to appreciate some of the new kids in the Triple IPA marketplace - specifically in reference to The Veil and Aslin.",4.53
Triple Sunshine,Canned 2/10/19,4.15
Triple Sunshine,Picked up a four pack at Lwason’s The other weekend. Pours a hazy orange with little head. Smells of strong pine & citrus. Tastes awesome....sticky and dank pineapple with plenty of citrus hops. Alcohol is there but we’ll in balance. A great nightcap beer. Glad to have tried this.,4.56
Triple Sunshine,A - Hazy golden tan color with light creamy foam on top.,4.13
Triple Sunshine,"Finally got the opportunity to have Triple Sunshine. The wait was long and the hype was probably more than it needed to be but here's my review. It pours as a golden yellow with a subtle hazy but mostly a clearer beer to say the least. The smell of the beer has a very pleasant hop aroma to it. The taste pretty well balanced between the hops and malt, reminding me of some of the original west coast IPA's that used to rule the beer world. The feel of this is actually a bit thinner than I expected, I suppose this was due to the increase in alcohol compared to how Double Sunshine feels. Overall this is definitely a great beer, I still prefer the Double Sunshine over this and Sip of Sunshine but this was still a treat and very glad to have tried it.",4.43
Triple Sunshine,"Fantastic IPA. Like the line of Sunshine beers from Lawson's, hop tastes range from citrus to something else. In the case of this triple hopped brew, lychee. Would really like to accurately know the hop profile, but Lawson's keeps those details close to the vest. The only downside to Triple Sunshine was that at the very end, a bit of booziness crept in. Still, a classic.",4.08
Triple Sunshine,"Prom night, your wedding night, the first time you played hide the salami with your significant other... what I am trying to get at, is that like these instances, there is a lot of expectation put upon this beer. So, did Triple Sunshine score from half court like Raul did on prom night? Kind of. I’m thinking more like it banked in, but I didn’t call my shot. The nose on thing thing is just dastardly and robust - think Karl Malden. I mean for real, this beer smells more ripe than Bar Rafieli’s pompoms. Appearance is all kinds of sexy like Isla Fisher in a pair of Jimmy Choo stilleto’s - yeah, I like dat. Now, this is when things get unbalanced, or just unfair; taste is good, I’m feeling it. But am I feeling it like Ariana Grande screamin’ “Breathin”? Close, but no cigar. Problem is that this beer was canned on 11/09/18; and according to Raul’s finger counting mathametics, that was a long time ago. Not like, hella long, but long enough that things probably have toned down a bit. When your boy drinks it, I get a tidal wave of Tahitian fruits, but unfortunately that wave of gloriousness dies quickly without much bite. And if you don’t know, bitinng can be gooda good thing. Roar.",4.09
Triple Sunshine,Can. White head. Golden orange color.,4.25
Triple Sunshine,"Pours a hazy murky golden color. The head is white, 2 finger, very frothy, with amazing retention. Some lacing as the head dissipates.",4.6
Triple Sunshine,"Good. However, my favorite is still Sip of Sunshine, followed by Double Sunshine, and then this one. I'll explain why. Here goes:",4.14
Triple Sunshine,Golden beer with an orange tint. The finger of white head fades and leaves some spotty lacing on the glass. Tropical fruit and floral notes emanate from the glass. There is pineapple and orange mixed with some herbal notes. Sweet beer with orange and and caramel. There are floral flavors and a nice bitter finish. Quite a tasty beer.,4.59
Triple Sunshine,"poured from a 12oz can into a snifter. pours a clear almost amber color with a minimal off white head. smells piney, and boozy, with a hint of caramel. taste is huge sticky piney hop resin. it’s bitter, warming with alcohol but very pleasant to drink. definitely a west coast vibe to this one, although on the west coast this would be a DIPA not triple. mouthfeel is full, lower carb and really complimentary to the style. overall, a very pleasurable drinking experience. this one hits hard but i think that’s the point - something that isn’t as easy drinking as regular sunshine but packs the punch and you know why after one 12oz can.",4.57
Triple Sunshine,"12oz. can served in a tulip. Canned 12/5/18. Pours a burnt orange hue with a slight haze to the clarity and a loose, fizzy, off-white head that quickly disperses into a tight band around the shoulders leaving an oily dollop across the center. Nose expresses pineapple, sweet orange and a hint of pith. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's a light maltiness to the flavor profile as well as an herbal/medicinal burst at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an even carbonation just shy of assertive. Overall, a nice Imperial IPA - not quite a juice bomb (which is a nice change form the norm) but a homage to older times.",4.21
Triple Sunshine,"Poured straight from the can, the beer pours a peachy orange color with pretty decent head retention and light lacing. On the nose I get considerable orange citrus, tropical fruit and pine, although the beer is also noticeably boozy, which tends to give the orange citrus aroma more of an orange syrup component. On the palate, this is just a hot mess. While there's some decent orange citrus and tropical fruit, the sweet malt comes on strong in the midpalate, which tends to accentuate the high alcohol in this beer. The beer is so hot and alcoholic on the finish that it completely overwhelms and drowns the considerable hoppy bitterness. The sweetness carries through on the finish, which unfortunately just makes an already boozy IPA taste even more alcoholic. The burn on the finish is unpleasant and makes drinking this beer an absolute chore (one I was unable fulfill, as I ended up dumping this half way through the glass).",2.88
Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Lots of good things happening here, my only issue was that this beer is that I thought the chili peppers were a bit over powering. I'm not a huge fan of chilis in beer to begin with, but I've had a few that balanced it well...this one over did it. On the plus side though, you do get lots of vanilla, chocolate, cinnamon, and a nice medium to full body. ",4.5

Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Dark brown pour with khaki head. Vanilla marshmallow bomb with a spicy kick. That's about all you need to know. Tastes delicious. Smooth, medium plus mouth feel. The maple adds sweetness in the background. The cinnamon blends nicely with the pepper adding some flavor. As this warms the bourbon and barrel character add to the mix and push this up into the 4.5 elite range. Really good. Trade for it.",4.46
Grande Negro Voodoo Papi - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Good but not great. Pour is dark, slightly thin with a dissipating tan head. Nose is very nice, some heat, bourbon and a little vanilla cinnamon combo. First sip is well carbonated, bourbon cocoa notes and then a slight heat from the peppers and spice from the cinnamon. Faint vanilla. As I take further sips the heat builds but still no maple and no sweetness from the vanilla to offset the spice. Then a slight alcohol burn starts to show up in the backend. Which is slightly off putting. I enjoy the heat from the peppers the balance there is good, but the lack of mouthfeel and alcohol burn at the end keep this from being great. Honestly I'd take a regular Huna over this any day.",4.14

Clover,Lucky enough to locate one of these with a friends help and am I ever glad I did! This is every bit as good as Ann in my opinion and better than Art which are 2 of the 3 beers in the blend. Crisp and clean with light carb and awesome barel notes,5
Black Note Stout,"2017 vintage. I have had this one sitting around for a while. Pours a dense jet black color with no light coming through. Surprisingly good size (medium) dark tan head. Filmy tan lacing on the glass. Rich malty aroma and flavor. A little a coffee, some chocolate. not much of the bourbon, but definitely some oak that adds a touch of bitterness to he mildly sweet flavor. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Some warming alcohol presence but no ""bite"". Goes down very easy. This is a top shelf stout!!!!",4.19
Black Note Stout,"2017 vintage, served just above fridge temp in a warm room, got a pretty wide variety of tastes and smells as it warmed up.",4.21
Black Note Stout,2016 12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter. This beer has aged well to this point. Tons of chocolate in the flavor with some touches of espresso contributing to a slightly dry finish. Black Note is a beer I'll continue to seek whenever available.,4.6

Black Note Stout,"2016 bottle. Pours a viscous jet black. Nose is bakers chocolate, smoke, leather, bourbon, brown sugar and time. Taste follows with dark stone fruit, cherry, plum, raisin , cardboard and old books. Mouthfeel in moderate to full. Surprisingly great with some age.",4.71

Black Note Stout,"I just had the 2017 Black Note Stout and it was great. It's hard to get where I live so I was happy to finally get my hands on it. What a wonderful stout, full bodied and flavorful and yet smooth and easy drinking. It is truly delicious.",4.7
Black Note Stout,"Pours so dark it is completely impervious to light. 2 fingers of mocha head slowly fade. Really great chocolate and bourbon aroma, fairly typical yet exceptional. Great chocolate flavor, very intense, bourbon barrel smooths it out and gives it a really nice barrel flavor. Tons of dark roasted malt flavor. Light bitter espresso finish. Full bodied, rich, thick, and creamy. Carbonation adds to a creamy texture. Overall an outstanding BBA Imperial Stout, worth buying a few if you come across it.",4.54
Black Note Stout,This one required at least four months bottle aging to round off the heat. But after that it's a mighty fine brew.,4.5
Black Note Stout,Reviewing this after having it about 2 months ago.,4.14
Black Note Stout,"Finally found this beer in a bottle at a grocery store in NYC on 75th and 2nd. I think its good, but not as unbelievable as some of the ratings indicate. The malt taste is solid, and definitely worth drinking, but I've tasted better amongst newer releases (Prison Double Barrel Wham Whams, Other Half 5th, etc.)",4.35
Black Note Stout,"2017 12oz bottle poured cold to a tulip glass. Dark mahogany brown with a two-finger bubbly mocha head. Lots of lacing that clings and doesn’t move, at all. Nose is faint vanilla and char, very subdued compared to what I thought it would be. First sips are woody, creamy stout, with a slight bourbon back-end linger. Very balanced flavor profile, with only a slight woody bite in the front. It’s almost like drinking “black.” Yeah, that sounds trippy, but it’s almost like not drinking anything other than a concept. It’s full, creamy, warming, filling. No alcohol presence, but it is warming. Very smooth, very easy to drink. I’m half-way through it, and am sad that it’s almost gone, with only one more on the shelf.",4.42
Black Note Stout,12oz bottle. 2017 bottling (10/05/017).,4.51
Black Note Stout,Phenomenal. Near perfect Drinkability and finish. This beer is smooth and perfectly balanced. You will not get a traditional place punchbof hops like most imperial stouts and that is not a bad thing.,4.79
Black Note Stout,"Review is of the 2017 edition. Poured from 12-ounce bottle into a snifter. Deep blackish-brown colored body, with a dark tan head that left a bit of sticky lacing. Good bourbon character but not harsh, nice alcohol warmth but not overly boozy, substantial mouthfeel without being syrupy. Big aromas and flavors of molasses, vanilla, cocoa, and dark roasted espresso bean, with moderate bitterness, no char, and some slightly sour oaky astringence on the finish. This seems to me to hit its sweet spot at slightly below cellar temperature, where everything settles into balance. As always, YMMV.",4.49
Black Note Stout,Not bad. Just wouldn't buy again. Has a licorice note on the nose and tongue that I don't really like. Overall the balance is good. BB character is mild which is good or bad depending on your preference.,3.73
Black Note Stout,"I have waited to rate until I drank about 18 of 2016 vintage and 18 of 2017 vintage.... It""s a good American Imperial Stout but I really don't think it is worth the hype and I am a Bells Brewery FANATIC! My main problem with the beer is the mouth feel. It does not compare with Bells Expedition Stout that is so thick and creamy. I was sooo expecting more! The flavor is great, the taste is okay but not overwhelming. I will always but this beer but I was a bit disappointed.",3.93
Black Note Stout,2017 bottle poured into fluted snifter.,4.4
Black Note Stout,Look: Pours black with minimal head. ,3.61
Black Note Stout,"Pours clear midnight pitch black but appears garnet hued when light is shined into it. The pour produces barely a finger of frothy, short-lived, dark mocha head that recedes to a thin collar ring and only a hint of island cap leaving minimal lacing on the sides of the glass. Aroma is toasted/burnt malt, bourbon/oak-wood fronted backed by Hershey's chocolate syrup, dark fruits, toffee and some coffee. Taste is almost the inverse: Hershey's chocolate syrup, fig/prune and caramel/toffee/molasses notes lead with bourbon, oak-wood vanilla, dark chocolate and coffee hints in the latter half of the sip and finish producing a bourbon, cocoa, burnt & bitter aftertaste. Roasted/toasted and sweet malt notes, fruitiness and barrel aging make this very, very nice. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with low carbonation, chewy, tongue coating creamy and silky smooth with a light prickle.",4.5

Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"10oz. tap sampled from a snifter at Ansari's - Eagan, MN. So, I love vanilla and for me this beer is absolutely delicious. Strong vanilla in the aroma and flavor. Thick and creamy. If someone told me I had to pick just one beer to drink for the rest of my life, this would be in the running.",5
Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Vanilla definitely takes the forefront on the nose, with a little bit of woodiness, as taste adds toasted double chocolate chip cookie with sweet vanilla glaze. A very mild bourbon heat and viscous, syrupy thick body finishes sticky, semi-dry. The after taste is total s'mores",4.21
Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"01/2017 - Lovely marshmallow, vanilla, wee graham, bourbon up front; sweet, creamy, bourbon, chocolate on body with vanilla lingering; amazing mouthfeel that's chewy and luscious.",4.53

Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Tasted from bottle. 2016 version. Pours dark brown with minimal tan head. Vanilla, caramel and bourbon aroma. Huge vanilla flavor along with caramel, coffee, molasses, bourbon. If you like vanilla you’ll like this one. Very well done.",4.32
Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Overwhelming vanilla smell and taste - hides the alcohol remarkably well and very smooth. I felt it was a bit thin and more like a porter consistency, but nevertheless it is quite decadent and worth the effort if you are fond of vanilla.",4.37
Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,Picked up a bottle of this at Julio's. Shared with JLindros.,4.38
Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,Thanks to rudzud,4.4
Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,Oh hell this is one glorious beer which delivers on all levels. Spot on chewy mouth feel and the vanilla helps round out the finish. Nose hides the alcohol well and vanilla is the predominant note although the taste is full,4.6
Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,330ml bottle.,4.8
Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,Pours dark chocolate in color. Aroma is the bigges vanilla ever. Flavor is vanillla upon more vanilla. This is a vanilla milk shake. Body is a little thin but overall pretty fantastic.,4.57
Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Not going to get to technical on this one. Dark, minimal head, smooth moderate to full mouth feel. That's said, big vanilla and bourbon on the nose, on the palate, forward and on the finish, awesome. Haven't had the base Vanilla Shake yet, but it's chilling in the cellar. Really looking forward to it even more now that I've had the BB edition.",4.65

Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"I really enjoy the Mikkeller Beer Geek series but this one took things to the next level. Its aroma is incredible and packs a ton of vanilla flavor with it. It's incredibly smooth for a 13% and the Bourbon taste is barely noticeable, a good thing for a sweet stout like this one.",4.88
Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Feel like this is overhyped. It's a nice BA vanilla stout for sure but I was underwhelmed by it. Pours dark brown, not opaque. Minimal head. Smell is some vanilla but I honestly expected alot more. Taste is exactly the same...some vanilla but I expected alot more. Has that typical Mikkeller aftertaste that I'm not a fan of. Feel was average, maybe a touch on the thinner side. Overall, this is good. I wouldn't classify it as great.",4.23
Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"I've never had a beer where the BA version was soooooo much better / different. I've had regular vanilla shake a number of times, and it never was that remarkable. But the BA version is very different. If you like vanilla stouts grab this one!",4.86
Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"2016 vintage, poured from the bottle into a tulip. Huge vanilla on the nose as it warms...well balanced with the barrel but not overly hot. Solid mouthfeel.",4.71
Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"330 mL bottle. Pours a murky black with no head. The thinnest of collars. Smells of vanilla, coffee, chocolate, and whiskey. Hefty oak. Tastes very oaky. Coffee throughout. Vanilla kicks in behind the coffee and makes it seem sweet. Bourbon kicks in and makes it seem less sweet. Eventually they combine to a bourbon and vanilla finish. Boozy and medium heavy with low carbonation. Excellent. Way over the top with the vanilla, but the barrel keeps it interesting.",4.14
Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"This was really good. Had is side by side with fundamental observation. The look was a nice dark look, good thickness. The smell was the best vanilla forward smell I've had from a vanilla stout. The taste was straight vanilla and barrel and I loved it. The mouth feel was perfect.",4.9

Anabasis,Blend #3.,4.66
Anabasis,"i have long been trying to track this one down, and i am stoked to finally have gotten the chance to enjoy it, blend three, an awfully fine example of the style, adjunct free if i understand it right, and truly wanting for nothing. it certainly is a beast of a beer, not just at this strength, but also with this amount of oak and sweetness, its a lot of everything, and its a proper sipper to say the least. deep deep caramel in color, reddish in the right light, neither murky nor clear, someplace in between, with just a short frothy khaki colored layer of foam on it from the bottle. the nose is crazy, an awful lot of bourbon and oak, i think it was heaven hill barrels they uses for this, and two years in them! heavy vanilla, wet tobacco, and english toffee abound there, some light tannins from the wood, as well as some oxidation when i taste it, something i never really mind in the style, and really is a sign of its maturity. the malt is huge, sweet like brown sugar and maple, and carrying that vanilla tune pretty nicely though the whole drink, a ton of body on it and a long linger even with the abundant alcohol at the end, its persistent. oxidation meets a robust english yeast strain too, bready and doughy even, adding a lot of depth. no hops really to speak of, although overall this somehow has some balance between all the elements at the end. whiskey for miles, boozy and sweet, dense and even chewy, but also fully wintery, warming, and satisfying. something to be shared for sure, but a prime example of the style and what extended barrel ageing looks like. impressive and worthy of being celebrated. that said, not the most interesting barleywine i have ever had, not the most dialed in i dont think either, but a special beer without a doubt!",4.42
Anabasis,"Pours murky brown. Nose is figs, raisins, toffee, caramel, butterscotch, bourbon, char. Taste is a bit more subtle, with a well balanced profile of the aforementioned aromas. Nice, sticky slick mouthfeel. Overall, a very nice example of the style. Almost drinks like a stout.",4.66
Anabasis,"Pours a very dark brown with ruby accents as it leaves the bottle and on the edges of the glass. No head. Aroma is toasty, roasty, caramel, butterscotch, herbal and floral hops. Flavor profile is butterscotch, toffee, caramel, and roasty, toasty malts. Big, deep complexity. Mouth feel is thick with a chewy texture. Overall, big, firm and filling. This is amazing. ",4.65
Anabasis,Batch 3 at Side Project - The Cellar.,4.75
Anabasis,"Old checkin. Had b1 alongside several derivations and TG stouts and it stole the show. Huge bourbon aroma, thick mouthfeel, complex chocolate and stout flavors, along with malty caramel and raisin sweetness. Had b2 a year later and it was great, maybe less bourbon forward than b1.",4.9
Anabasis,There are two things that most craft beer nerds get wrong about Anabasis: ,4.43
Anabasis,"12/2017 - incredible aromas of bourbon, light anise, plum, tobacco, and earthiness; smooth creamy body with raisin, sherry, tobacco, and nice semisweet flavors; supremely luscious mouthfeel that just blows me away; the finish is surprisingly dry and balanced.",4.88
Anabasis,"A mix between a stout and a barleywine, lil roasty and underwhelming next to some of the biggest barleywines we had next to it blind. Not something I will be going after in the future.",4.08
Anabasis,"Had batch 2 on site from a keg. Easily the best barleywine I have ever had in my life. This shit is fire. If you are able to track down a bottle (will take a lot), you wont be disappointed",4.96
Anabasis,"750ml waxed bottle, served in a Side Project stemmed glass. Pours a darker brown body, one finger offwhite head, one finger white head, good retention, nice lacing. Smell is rich caramel, earth, toffee, bourbon, oak, vanillin. This is very much the barrel-aged barleywine. Flavour follows, heavy oak, caramel, toffee, vanillin, oak, slight earth, nice complexity, fairly sweet. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, nice toffee and barrel on the finish. A very nice and heavy barleywine with a lot of sweetness; it doesn't seem to offer more oomph than say, Revolution Straight Jacket for example. I feel like this is a bit overhyped despite this being an excellent barrel aged English Barleywine.",4.49
Anabasis,Batch 2,4.77
Anabasis,"B2 at the cellar. Traded my first bottle(b1) 18 months and 62 trades ago as my first trade. Thanks Morandi, especially enjoyed befuddlement especially, but I'm happy to finally have this puppy tonight!",4.62
Anabasis,"Batch #2 at the brewery on 3-4-17. Shared 3 ways so my wallet didn't feel the pain that much. Pours extreme dark brown with no head. This is a spectacular example of how barrel aging a barley wine can transform into a whole different brew. Sweet and succulent on the nose, with toffee and caramel notes blended with a light barrel note. Taste is off the chart. There was a grainy particulate or something that my tongue picked up that melted on the tongue and the toffee flavor that became borderline chocolate. Incredible.",5
Anabasis,Had bottle 1 during a Barley wine Bottle Share. ,5
Anabasis,"Amazing barley wine with wonderful layers of bourbon, dark fruit and raisins with light caramel notes as well . Had this as part of a barley wine tasting with several other world-class barley wines and this one stole the show!",5
Anabasis,had this one blind out of 18 total barleywines. ,4.93
Anabasis,"Pours full and rich with creamy carb, praline sweetness and slight booze on the nose, huge raisin and oats on the taste with some prune, fig, wood, and slight heat, creamy mouthfeel goes down dangerously easy. One of my white whales that took a team of us to bring down. Thanks Patrick and Myles!",5
Anabasis,"Just an incredible beer, strong but smooth, boozy but not overly so. Tastes a little of caramel, but not overly sweet. Certainly the best barleywine I've ever had, possibly the best beer.",4.98
Anabasis,"750 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Murky deep brown body with a small khaki head. Absurdly boozy aroma. Brown sugar, raisins, bourbon. Nutty and oaky. Taste is also extremely boozy. Bourbon and oak dominate. Nutty and caramel malts. Bitter. I expect a lot more sweetness. It's sweet, but not absurdly sweet. Heavy body. Medium carbonation. It gets pretty sweet as I drink it, but still really good. Well done.",4.34
Triple Shot,No bottling date but I picked this up at the brewery way back on 6/13/19. It says not to age but I wasn’t in a rush to drink it with so many other beers in the fridge having shorter lifespans.,4.59
Triple Shot,"this stuff is divine, and in such an unassuming package too, crazy! thanks to my brother for sourcing this rarity, thought i might never get to taste this one. its a treat too, so much coffee, enough so even that is stands out as way more than the vanilla bean double shit, which we enjoyed right before this one. its almost gritty and bitter in comparison, but the vanilla sure did a lot to sweeten that up and round it out. here we have a truer expression of the coffee, more isolated in a way, and i love how robust it is, almost as much coffee as it is beer, although i do get a little booziness poking through this one in the aroma. the coffee has deep chocolate tones to it, a little spiciness even, a rigid sort of bitterness mid palate, and a real richness as well, notes of molasses and maple work in from the grain here, and there is a neat almost amaretto layer. maybe not quite as complex as the double shot was to me, a little more straight forward from the grain, but i love the way the coffee manifests itself in here, about as forward as i have known it to be in any beer, and lingering forever on the palate after each slow sip. this is the ultimate coffee beer really, and the freshness of the coffee really stands out as well, especially for something that was bottle many months before we opened it. it was wonderful to finally get to drink some of these hard to get tree house stouts, thanks to my brother! these were unforgettable!",4.5
Triple Shot,A- 500ml bottle pours a motor oil black brew into a snifter. A very thick and creamy cap rises out of the beer like a layer of dark cocoa brown cream atop the liquid. Great head retention and massive piles of lacing stick to the glass.,4.58
Triple Shot,"Traded for this last week as this was one of the few beers that I've had here at the house recently that was fresh. Loved the iterations of the Double Shot that I traded for (with the same person) a few weeks back and this was just as good as those. The label describes this as being ""like a melted chocolate bar"" and that would be quite apt how rich, silky, and luscious this was. If you love Stouts of any kind, then this would easily be one worth seeking!",4.44
Triple Shot,"Pours black with two and a half fingers of dense caramel-colored foam. Head retention is sublime. Aroma is roasty, toasty, nutty, earthy, caramely and bready malts with rich coffee coming over the top and lingering into the finish. Chocolate (milk and cocoa) and toffee add little bits of sweetness to the middle and finish of the beer. Flavor profile is roasty, toasty, nutty, earthy, bready and caramely malts. Beyond malts is a dense cup of medium-bodied, coffee, with hints of nuts and chocolate. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a rich, creamy texture that creates a decadent experience in itself. Overall, rich coffee paired beautifully with a myriad of dark malts for a decadent, robust stout.",4.72
Triple Shot,"This one pours a very dark black color, with a small but tight and long lasting head, and a ton of lacing.",4.51
Triple Shot,TREE HOUSE TRIPLE SHOT COFFEE STOUT 6/22/19,4.64
Triple Shot,500 ml. bottle.,4.67
Triple Shot,"Superb dark body, opaque and solid, brown head, tiny bubble lines and nearly full curtain. The nose is full of malt, roasty and toasty, with cherry and dark chocolate flavors joining it in the taste. The feel is full and satisfying. Delicious.",4.43
Triple Shot,500ml bottle. ,4.35
Triple Shot,"Viscous burnt black with a tall stark mocha head that slowly settles to a lumpy bubbly blanket with creamy wisps, a thick collar and a few reaching arms of lace.",4.1
Triple Shot,"batch 1000 500ml for NYE. having had 2bl shot two different batches, this was in my pervue. This was over and beyond expectations. Best stout I had in 2018.",4.42
Triple Shot,"Big thanks to rudzud for picking this up, I think. Just got through hell trying to add water filter system to the house, trying to hook it up to the house water line was hell, so need this",4.53
Triple Shot,"500ml bottle, snifter glass. Dark black body, half finger mocha head, fair retention, no lacing. Smell and flavour is a massive and delicious espresso and a bit of roast bean, smooooooooooth milk chocolate, a bit of fudge, lactose, a bit of tobacco and roast malt. Comes out to something like a massive espresso shake, sort of like a frappe. Full bodied, silky and smooth, creamy and full-flavoured. Delicious!",4.5
Triple Shot,"One of the best mouthfeel stouts I've ever had, unfortunately I'm not a big fan of the yeast character of Tree House stouts but this was my favorite of the ones I've tried.",4.17
Triple Shot,Sampling a cold bottle poured into my snifter. Beer is a dark chocolate brown on the pour with a creamy tan head of about 1 cm. The foam sticks around as a wispy surface layer for most of the sampling. The aroma is dark chocolate and toffee with some brown sugar. I also get a little bit of coffee ground and a background of vanilla. I dont really get any hops nor booze on this beer.,4.52
Triple Shot,"03/2015 - This beer is absolutely incredible - seek it out! Intense espresso, vanilla, toffee, lactose on the nose; superb coffee, rich chocolate, maple, vanilla on the palate; solid mouthfeel but it thins out of the finish; rich, chocolaty finish.",4.46
Triple Shot,"beautiful looking brew, quite aromatic and delicious flavors on palate. there is a robust and deep chocolate quality - getting milky chocolate bar, bakers chocolate, oreos, chocolate chip cookie, caramel, robust and slightly bitter coffee notes, a mellow dark fruit flavor and a massive roastyness. smooth medium bodied mouthfeel.",4.52
Triple Shot,Very dark appearance with slight dark brown/tan head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a coffee and malt. Taste is a very smooth pleasant coffee and malt with some chocolate.,4.67
Triple Shot,"Pours dark and thick with lacing tan head. Smell is coffee and dark roasted malts with dark chocolate. Taste is smooth cold brew coffee with no bitterness at all commonly found in coffee stouts. Silky, lingering mouthfeel. Overall a very pleasant easy sipper.",4.63
Triple Shot,Beer #2000,4.59
Triple Shot,Really as good as you get for a non ba stout. Fluffy and creamy with heavy coffee. Not a huge treehouse stout fan but the hot this one out of the park!,4.84
Triple Shot,"Tasted from bottle. Pours black with dark brown head. Aroma is big time coffee, molasses, cocoa. Super creamy. No hint of alcohol. Really it’s like a thick coffee. Milk chocolate, brown sugar, molasses, cream and of course coffee. Incredibly good.",4.82
Triple Shot,"Poured from bottle into shaker, good 1 finger dark tan head that hangs around a while, recedes to a pool after a few, good lacing. Smells predominantly of chocolate, very little coffee on the nose. Taste follows the nose, good dose of sweet chocolate. Very little coffee coming thru, very little bitterness/bite, hidden mainly by the sweetness.",3.91
Triple Shot,"The beer pours Pitch Black with a big fluffy khaki head. It has medium carbonation. The beer smells of baker’s chocolate, cocoa powder, roasted coffee beans, bark, and almonds. It tastes of roasty coffee, cocoa powder, vanilla, bark, and almonds. It has a medium body. A great coffee beer, a heftier version of Double Shot.",4.53
Bourbon Paradise,"From a 12 oz. bottle into a PAA Dino glass, this beer pours out with a slick blackness and almost touching a motor oil thickness. Caramel colored bubbles that disappear as fast as they can form leave no crown. 4.25",4.9
Bourbon Paradise,Stark black with a thin tan blanket dying off to nothing but a tar surface.,4.18
Bourbon Paradise,Unusually smooth and drinkable for a nearly 16% Stout. I really enjoyed the standard Paradise and this one-upped it. Damn good. Drink it - with caution!,4.53
Bourbon Paradise,"12 oz. bottle @ home. Pours a pitch black colour. Brown head that quickly disappears. Aroma's of cocos, milk chocolate, light boozy alcohol/bourbon. Retronasal there's a bit more of the bourbon, with chocolate, cocos, some red fruit. Flavour is heavy sweet, chocolatey, bourbon-y, a bit roasted. Alcohol feel is definitely strong and warming but not burning. Medium to full bodied. Finishes with bourbon and chocolate. Great but dangerous stuff.",4.21
Bourbon Paradise,B2,4.6
Bourbon Paradise,2018 Vintage,4.51
Bourbon Paradise,"12/2017 - I am excited to see how this improves over time. For now, it has incredible bourbon, coconut, vanilla, cocoa aromas; decadent body with no apparent heat; creamy, sweet finish. There's absolutely a lot of bottle variation on this though - the first time I was blown away, the second time, not as much.",4.55
Bourbon Paradise,"Tasted from bottle. Pours dark brown with beige head. Cocoa, bourbon, coconut and just a hint of vanilla on aroma. Thick and chewy. Chocolate, caramel, molasses, coconut flavors. Faint vanilla finish. Excellent BA stout.",4.75
Bourbon Paradise,"A 12 fl. oz. bottle with a Julian bottled on date of, I want to say, 32517, but it’s not so clear. Meaning that it was bottled on 21st November 2017. Poured into a snifter glass.",4.67
Bourbon Paradise,Poured from 12oz bottle into glass. Date stamp is '32017'.,4.31
Bourbon Paradise,"Drank from a 12fl. oz. bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA",4.37
Bourbon Paradise,"Dark brown color with a ring of tan foam. Aroma has coconut, booze, whiskey and rum. Taste is sweet with fudge, dark chocolate brownies, bourbon and toffee with a bitter, roasty finish. Medium plus body with medium carbonation. Nice flavors but quite boozy.",4.4
Bourbon Paradise,Bourbon Paradise - Prairie,4.59
Bourbon Paradise,"The beer pours a Pitch Black with a medium sized khaki head. The beer has low carbonation. It smells of coconut, vanilla, whipped cream, marzipans, and a little bourbon. It tastes of toasted coconut, vanilla, egg whites, whipped cream, marzipans, and bourbon. The body is medium full. This is an amazing stout, there are so many coconut stouts these days but this one stood out in a big way.",4.81
Bourbon Paradise,"Courtesy of Collins - thanks, bruv!",3.35
Bourbon Paradise,"Bourbon barrel aged imperial stout aged with coconut and vanilla. Chocolate, vanilla, marshmallow, toasted coconut, Maple syrup, lightly roasted malt, oak and booze. Medium bodied. Fairly bitter finish balances out the sweetness. Very solid and delicious.",4.39
Bourbon Paradise,"This is very good, but I scored it a bit lower because of the pure strength of prairie’s other BA offerings such as Pirate Bomb and BA bible belt, which are a lot more impactful than this one. Nice rich fudge base, good strong bourbon barrel bite. The coconut isn’t really coming through too much. The vanilla is in the background.",4.28
Bourbon Paradise,"Poured a pitch black color, body appeared a little thin and with no head. Strong aromas of vanilla, toasted coconut and heavy bourbon. In fact, as it warmed up, the bourbon became only stronger and pretty much dominated the nose. The flavors were pretty much spot on: coconut, sweet vanilla and boozy whiskey. It all kind of comes together tasting like chocolate liqueur, a hot boozy dessert. Mouthfeel is fully body and warm, again boozy. Overall: it came in 12 oz. bottles and it should only come in 12 oz. bottles. Finishing it was almost a chore. It was fantastic at first but as it warmed up, it just became a hot mess.",4.06
Bourbon Paradise,Interesting variant. Many of the things you seek with Prairie imp stouts. Overall a very good sipper with a delightful change of pace flavor wise. The base plus vanilla and coconut created a sum flavor that recalled coconut meringue and subtle vanilla bruelle... then enhanced by the roasty malt and bit of dried figs. The whiskey and wood furthered the complexity. Hints of lime... go figure. ,4.66
Bourbon Paradise,An absolute monster of a beer; had a bottle over the course of an entire evening (and I mean entire) with a very different experience upon first opening and then a couple hours later.,4.42
Bourbon Paradise,Beer pours a Black! With no head. The smell is bourbon which is why the smell is the lowest rating. The taste is spectaculor plain and simple. Butterscotch is what hits and the bourbon doesn't mess up the swallow. Nice and smooth overall a fantastic beer!!!!!!!!!!!,4.39
Bourbon Paradise,"i wasnt the biggest fan of the original paradise, way too sweet and way too much vanilla, just totally over the top, comical proportions really, purely novelty sort of brew, at least for me, but this special barrel aged version improves it considerably i reckon, with the coconut really coming out, enhanced by the sweet whiskey and charred oak. i also get a lot more of the roasted grain character than i ever did in the base beer by itself, bitter with some coffee essence, rich still and absolutely sugary, even splitting a small bottle of this felt like a ton of beer, with the alcohol and the sugar just dripping out of it. cool nuance here, not all vanilla, some light smoke, some wet oak, good bourbon and charcoal, milk chocolate desserty vibes, and dried fruits like raisins and figs. the coconut is floral and new and nice, toasted and baked tasting, awesome with the vanilla, which tastes less syrupy and more natural here than it did in the original, owing to the barrel i reckon. huge body and a ton of booze, this is sludgy and thick and viscous to the max, but it lets all the flavors slowly and semi permanently coat the palate, and its pretty agreeable to me overall. maybe not quite worthy as one of the top beers in the world, that seems like a stretch for it, but a special treat nevertheless and another cool one from prairie. huge thanks to my buddy for sharing this one with me, a rarity indeed! diabetic but delicious.",4.45

Saint Lamvinus,"
Overall, a great lambic, a gateway between beer and wine.",4.35
Saint Lamvinus,"Cantillon Saint Lamvinus, 7% ABV. Pours a beautiful deep red, with a one finger pinkish head that dissipated while I got a good picture, leaving no lacing. Nose is light grape and wine. Taste is dry wine with some tartness, and not much bitterness or funk. Feel is decent, good carbonation and dry. Overall excellent. I know this is highly rated, but I'm not loving it.",4.1
Saint Lamvinus,"Between wine and beer, this one is the least funky brew I've had from Cantillon. Pungeant notes of merlot are present. The lambic is present to balance the whole but never dominates the beverage. ",4.96
Saint Lamvinus,"Had this outside and it had a striking bright red color with a wispy pink head. Aroma was fresh cherries mixed with barnyard funk. The taste featured slightly tart cherries with red grapes, hay, leather, some bleu cheese, and funk. A nice long red-wine finish. Light-to-medium bodied and extremely easy to drink.",4.53
Saint Lamvinus,"This is indeed a great Belgian Lambic. It might be the best Lambic I've ever had, but it certainly wasn't easy to get in the states.",4.71
Saint Lamvinus,"Earthy, wonderfully tart and lightly sour, funky - beautiful pour, lightly effervescent and carbonated. The grapes are pungent and rich in the mouth.",4.68
Saint Lamvinus,"09/2013 - always a consistently elegant, complex, and just damn delicious lambic; the grape pops everywhere, classic cheesy funk; dope as fuck from beginning through the finish, no matter the vintage.",4.71
Saint Lamvinus,"Poured a non-translucent light purple color - almost like diluted grape juice. Very little head on presentation. The smell is tart, dry and vinous with a whiff of grape skins and oak. Some funk pushing through in the nose. The taste is so balanced and easy to drink. It's tart, dry (not as dry as many of their other fruit lambics), mildly sour with just a slight oak mustiness and notes of fresh grapes skins. While it is an overall dry lambic, there is some sweetness from the grapes that balances out the tartness. It has a medium bodied mouthfeel with just mild acidity, not too harsh. Overall, one of the better Cantillon's I've tried. It really stands out for being well balanced. While it used Merlot grapes, I wouldn't describe the beer having a taste resembling the qualities of Merlot (leathery and dark fruits), however this is a 2014 bottle and it may differ from a fresher version. It does have a nice vinous quality which I assume are from the Merlot grapes.",4.62
Saint Lamvinus,Soft ripe exotic grape creamy with enough lactic but not too much not yogurt level. Next level blending skills or just right in my wheelhouse. Absolutely reccomend if given the chance to try. Possibly a touch above Fou?,4.59
Saint Lamvinus,"One of the best Cantillon beers I’ve tried. 2016 bottle poured into a stemmed bulb. Pours hazy and pulpy plum purple color. Beautiful color. Aromas of earthy grape and funk. Taste is amazing. The grapes used in this are so unique and just taste so amazing. Earthiness, funk and some hints of red wine. Feel is thick for this style. Drinks with some body. Overall, this is an amazing Lambic and one of the best I’ve had.",4.77
Saint Lamvinus,Look: Clear Purple with medium pink fizzy head that recedes immediately. Has medium carbonation.,4.42
Saint Lamvinus,"Look: thick 1.5 purple red head, color is a clear blood red ",4.47
Saint Lamvinus,"Pours a cloudy burgundy with a thin almost pinkish white ring of foam around the edge. The nose is not stellar in this beer. Strong barnyard, but not pleasant like other cantillon beers. A bit vinegary and only hints of the vine. The taste is altogether different from the nose. Very balanced with an ultra sweet middle, mild funk, and clean dry finish. Not really vinous in flavor, more grapeish. Feel is light and effervescent. Overall this beer scares you when you take a whiff but it unexpectedly lives up to the hype in the flavor which has no bearing to the smell. There is a little bit of wine in the nose but approaches more grape.",4.22
Saint Lamvinus,"I have had several vintages of this and I must say I like it more young. The wine is not overbearing but provides a brightness that is just wonderful. Dark fruit on the nose and palate. Some funk, but not overbearing. It was more like blackberry or jam than wine but this was tasty.",4.63
Saint Lamvinus,"5800th review! 750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 11/14/2016. Listed at 7% on the label. Cork was wet under the cap, and almost fell apart removing it. Pours lightly hazy ruby reddish orange/pink/purple color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy light pink head with good retention, that reduces to a thin ring of lace that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart plum, apricot, cherry, raspberry, strawberry, cranberry, red grape, fruit skin, lemon, lime, green apple, grapefruit, hay, straw, grass, cork, wood, wheat, and cracker; with lighter notes of leathery/musty funk, vanilla, red wine vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance of complexity of fruity/funky/fairly acidic yeast, red grapes, pale malt, and oak barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart plum, apricot, cherry, raspberry, strawberry, cranberry, red grape, fruit skin, lemon, lime, green apple, grapefruit, hay, straw, grass, cork, wood, wheat, and cracker; with lighter notes of leathery/musty funk, vanilla, red wine vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Light-moderate fruity/lactic tartness; light fruit tang and yeast/oak spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of tart plum, apricot, cherry, raspberry, strawberry, cranberry, red grape, fruit skin, lemon, lime, green apple, grapefruit, hay, straw, grass, cork, wood, wheat, cracker, light leather/funk/vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/fairly acidic yeast, red grapes, pale malt, and oak barrel flavors; with an awesome malt/tartness balance, and zero puckering flavors after the finish. Light-moderate increasing dryness from tartness and tangy/tannic fruit/oak. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, fairly crisp, and acidic/tangy/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol for 7%. Overall this is an excellent fruit lambic. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/fairly acidic yeast, red grapes, pale malt, and oak barrel flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink with the modestly lactic/tangy/tannic/drying finish. Well rounded Brett complexity and solid Lacto presence. Perfectly balanced between grapes, oak, and malts. Was expecting way more out of this. Not as much depth in funky complexity, and not as jammy/vinous on fruit character as I wanted. A very enjoyable offering, and spot on style example otherwise.",4
Saint Lamvinus,"Split with Goblinmunkey7 on 8/8/17, review from notes",4.53
Saint Lamvinus,"Plum purple with a small purple-tinted head that quickly forms a bubbly crown. Light Merlot and barnyard funk in the nose. Delicate fruity taste: cherry, grape, red wine. Modest sourness midpalate. Nice acidic wine barrel finish. Relatively light bodied with low carbonation. Delicious.",4.2
Saint Lamvinus,"2016 vintage poured from fridge temp but allowed to warm. Pours a ruby pinkish color with surprisingly little carbonation. Cork was a bit deformed and seemed very wet. Smell is out of this world. Vanilla, red grapes, apricot, sour, scrumptious. I get some sweet candy on the nose as well. Taste is amazing - quite a departure from the nose. A quick bitterness springs forward on first taste, but then settles with a sweet finish. The sour isn't overwhelming. Definitely getting grapes, cherries, apricot. Such a nice balance and has amazing mouthfeel. Not too thick, but lingers. Overall, an amazing beer.",4.4

Keene Idea,fresh growler drank on 8/3/2017,4.5
Keene Idea,"Love the hops in this one, which is easily one of Alpine's best. The only bad thing about Keene Idea is that they (to my knowledge) haven't bottled it yet. I would stock up like crazy!",4.57
Keene Idea,"This beer is awesome, wish they would bottle it so I could have it all the time. Loved this beer and going to Alpine is a great brewery to visit. The nicest guys ever there. Looking forward to this being released again",4.75
Keene Idea,"Stone fruit and juiciness on the nose give way to grapefruit citrus flavor and some dank , with slight bitterness. One of best DIPAs I've had and Alpine's best IMO",4.64
Keene Idea,Had on Tap at Hopocalyse Day 1/23/16,4.31
Keene Idea,"From growler. Pours a slightly hazy copper orange. Multi finger foam head with reasonable retention. Solid lacing. Smells of good, clean, hop fun. Bitter and earthy smell. A nice, more simple, great tasting beer. Bitter pine that makes way to a hint of fresh grapefruit. Smooth feel with strong carbonation and an assertive hop stick. Best ipa I've tried from these guys, thus far.",4.59
Keene Idea,"Pours a burnt orange color with a thick white head that dissipates some throughout drinking. Solid lacing on the glass. Nice tropical smell on the nose with some of the nelson character as well. Taste reflects that soft citrus flavor with nice bitterness shining through. Great, smooth mouthfeel that you look for with the upper echelon IPA class. Best IPA offering from these guys in my opinion",4.58
Keene Idea,Just had the Keene Idea for the first time today.. Went to get Nelsons.. Now I want Keene Idea.. The same Nelson Hops used here. Little more Boozy than the Nelson but still so so drinkable and absolutely my new best from Alpine !,4.98
Keene Idea,"Poured from 64oz growler into tulp crystal clear orange in color with white head that vanished quickly. (I believe because i didnt get to open it soon enough) smells of tropical fruit, pineapple and citrus. Ice lacing and great tasting beer at a 8.8%. Piney and hoppy! Would like to get some bottle to beable to get the full flavor. Im a Nelson guy myself but another great IPA from Alpine",4.43
Keene Idea,"32oz ABC growler, served in a snifter glass 9/30/2015.",4.49
Keene Idea,"Deep copper color with a fingernail of off white around the rim. The aroma is piney and honey sweet. I taste a massive amount of piney hops. The mouth is thick, chewy, and overall dense.",4.15
Keene Idea,"Very nice aroma and blend of hops, remarkably smooth for a 9%. The higher alcohol content is not very noticeable, but can be noticeable if you let it warm up, so definitely drink it chilled. This is probably my favorite IPA by Alpine with bad boy a close second.",4.68
Keene Idea,64 oz. growler poured into a snifter.,4.2
Keene Idea,Pours and orange hazy color with moderate head retention. Smells very citrusy with some mango notes. Tastes a lot of grapefruit with this beer with a moderate bitter finish. Moderate mouth feel with perfect carbonation for this beer. Another excellent Alpine offering.,4.72
Keene Idea,"Not quite as good as Bad Boy, but different and special in its own way. Another example of the great SoCal IPAs that have a lot of hops but still make them drinkable and enjoyable.",4.6
Keene Idea,"The one and only time I've made the pilgrimage to Alpine Beer, this was on tap. I had no idea what it was and in hindsight I consider myself a lucky man for being able to drink a pint of this my first time there. I will absolutely be on the lookout for when they tap it again. Absolutely incredible IPA.",4.91
Keene Idea,This is like Nelson on crack. So delicious. Barely noticeable ABV. One Alpine beer you know you're getting from their production and not Green Flash. Must try. Another winner from Alpine.,4.8
Keene Idea,"Like liquid hop candy, yet with a basic enough malt base to never veer off into syrupy sweet territory. Arguably the best beer Alpine puts out, and that's saying something.",4.65
Keene Idea,So freaking good! Not as good as Bad Boy but the dry hop on this beer is so amazing. Has that cloudy ipa look that I love and it so smooth and drinkable. I wish I could have a tap of this straight from Alpine in my house.,4.81
Keene Idea,"Alpine's litmus test to me involved having Keene Idea (originally Toronado's 25th Anniversary beer) on a beer list already with outstanding beers. I prefer not to use tasters because I like to soak up a greater experience with a given beer, so after a round a Nelson, Keene Idea had a high mark to hit. On to the beer:",4.6

Flora Plum,"I had the great fortune of sharing a bottle of Flora Plum with a close friend when visiting Cape Cod in the summer of 2018. Quite possibly the best sour I've had. Beautiful color and such delicate flavors, worth the money (which was substantial, I think this was the most expensive glass of beer I've been lucky enough to enjoy), truly spectacular.",5
Flora Plum,"Batch 1: Bright gold pour, light haze, smaller head that fizzles out fast. amazing balance in the aroma and taste here. Slightly under-ripe yellow plum, rustic notes, wheat, barnyard funk, lemon notes, lighter oak notes, light vanilla sweetness, light yogurt lactic sourness. Nothing here exhausts the palate - no one component completely takes over this beer. Lighter body, carbonation is spot on.",4.63

Overall, solid; however, not much fruit is evident.",4.01

Flora Plum,Flora Plum batch 2,3.81
Flora Plum,"Juicy ripe plums picked and appropriately timed to perfection in this beer. Incredible nectar and plenty of gleeky-sourness to it without the harsh finish, very smooth on the way down. This is hands down one of the very best fruited saisons I've ever had the pleasure to try. The pour is a hazy yellow trillium ipa with minimal lacing around the edge of the glass. Aroma is intense with fruit, something unique about the funk... it's not overwhelming but reminds me for some reason of a Russian River sour. The way the sweetness lingers through the finish and the smooth mouthfeel ends with no puckering, this thing is awesome.",4.63
Flora Plum,Bottle shared by Curran on my wedding day- thanks a ton man.,4.64
Flora Plum,"My first HF Flora variant. And while I'm admittedly not that big into plums, I still found this to be an enjoyable brew. I'm glad I had this during summer, it was very refreshing.",4.19
Flora Plum,"This is head and shoulders above the other Flora variants and among HF's best saisons. Had both batches at a recent tasting. Both are excellent, but batch 1 had a flavor that had burned in and integrated, and a bit more funk that put it over the top. Seek out.",4.74
Flora Plum,Well balanced fruited wild ale. The beer is a vehicle for the plum. I miss some of the nuance of Flora as the base beer takes a backseat to the tartness and acidity of fresh plum. The mouthfeel draws character from the plum skin with a finishing dryness and crisp tartness. The flavors harmonize as they warm slightly with a fuller plum flesh flavor and aroma. Very nice expression of fresh plums.,4.47
Flora Plum,"Batch 1. Super hazy yellow color with a rush of head when the bottle was opened. The nose is plum and earthy, but somewhat muted. Taste is a very full plum / sour taste. Feel is very juicy and feeling, just overwhelms you in a good way. Overall this is a fantastic beer.",4.62
Flora Plum,"Traded for this a while ago and was waiting for the right moment to enjoy it peacefully by myself....that happened last night and it was outstanding! Light tart, light plum fruit notes but decent fruit character! Extremely drinkable and refreshing and I would love to get more! Excellent fruited offering by HF!",4.53
Flora Plum,"Batch 2, poured into a taster. Tart with a mild funk, the plum shines through nicely and is incorporated well with a bit of white wine barrel. Good, crisp carbination. Well done.",4.42
Flora Plum,"Murky peach color. Aroma has lots of fruits like quince, plum, apricot, pear and some lambic style funk but quite clean overall. Taste follows with the same fruits I got on the aroma. Not overly sour but it has a good amount of fruit acidity. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. A really well done sour fruit beer resembling the lambic style.",4.5
Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,"Pours a mango-orange with a murky transparency and a finger of white foam that retains well. Aroma is earthy papaya, tangerine and grapefruit with a little stone and yeast beyond. It's tropical fruit opening lingers for a while, letting the base pale ale (which is already very hoppy) show throw in fragments. Aroma is akin to a very powerful NE IPA. Flavor profile is papaya, tangerine, mango, tangerine with a little earthy, nutty malt and raw grain and yeast to sooth things out. It's tropical fruit through and through, and drinks very similar - identical - to Trillium's Northeast IPA (this is labeled as an American Pale Ale at the time of review). All this to say, it's incredible hop forward, much more so than other pale ales, which may be a deterrent for some. Mouth feel is a little gritty, silty and soft, with a medium-thick consistency. It's liken to a well-worn lumpy, linen pillow. Overall, despite a slightly misleading style, the name of the beer lets those knowledgeable about beer that the hop content is going to be high, thus I will not knock it for the style mis-interpretation. It's big and flavorful, which is welcome in a beer. It combines well with the lightly gritty texture to develop a refined, but well-worn and knowledgeable, experience.",4.39

Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,"Theres just something about trillium beers and this one is not exception. They call it a Pale and that's definitely up for debate. But whats not up for debate, is the notation that this is a world class brew! Because it is! The Galaxy dry hop on this beer gives it an extra does of that New Zealand Spiciness while at the same time delivering distinct tropical notes and trillium's yeast strain helps to add a dry snappy finish.

V.S.O.J.,The finest example of the style I've had since King Henry. This beer was a true delight and I'd recommend it to anyone. Well worth the effort to find one of these gems. The barrel flavor and mouthfeel on this beer was incredible.,4.98
V.S.O.J.,"I'm not particularly a fan of barleywines or Straightjacket for that matter, but I got to try this at a share recently and I fully understand why it is a favorite and top-rated beer!!! Absolutely amazingly smooth. I wouldn't change a thing about this. Outstanding! I will search this one out in the future for sure",4.86

V.S.O.J.,"2018 vintage tasted in a snifter from draft at O'Toole's on February 5, 2019. A celebration of malt, oak and patience. Very Special Old [Straight] Jacket is a cuvée of English barleywines each aged between two and three years in bourbon barrels. Lusciously sweet and colossally complex, V.S.O.J. is equal parts refinement and excess.",4.57
V.S.O.J.,"12 oz can poured into a tulip. Appearance was a little off putting as this was very dark brown. Not the color I'm used to from a typical barley wine. Small off-white head that dissipated quick. Aroma was off the charts....lots of barrel character such as bourbon and wood. Dark fruit was heavily present. Lots of fig, raisin and prune and a hint of tobacco. Flavor was everything I detected in the aroma. Tons of fig, raisin and prune...lots of bourbon and oak. Very rich. Feel was medium bodied. Kinda stout like which is thicker for a barley wine. Overall, this was fantastic. A real treat to have. Glad to have been able to try.",4.6

Incredible",4.75
V.S.O.J.,"Probably the best barleywine I will ever have and one of my all time favorite beers. It's so rich and decadent. Pours a dark brown with hues of red. Smells like caramel, toffee, and bourbon all mixed together. Tastes amazing. Complex flavors last a long time and change as the beer warms up. Really goes to show what a great barrel program Rev has going.",4.99
V.S.O.J.,"The best got even better. I love regular Straight Jacket and I could drink it every day, but I never have enough. This is like regular SJ on steroids and HGH. Everything that is awesome about SJ but even better. More intense flavor but also more nuance, depth and complexity. I'd even say that this is better than HF Aaron. Best English barleywine I've ever had bar none. Barleywine is life.",5
V.S.O.J.,Head and shoulders above VSOD - VSOJ is like Straight Jacket cranked up to 11.,4.6
V.S.O.J.,"Nearly appearing like a stout, this has a dark brown to blackish body with faint red edges under a creamy, uneven khaki blanket that fades to a thick bubbly ring. A swirl leaves wide, clear legs drooping over the surface forever.",4.9
V.S.O.J.,"Straight 5's here, this beer is absolutely outstanding! I honestly don't know how you could improve on this. Massive barrel, caramelized sugar/fig/vanilla flavor.",5
V.S.O.J.,"10/17/18 (Chicago): $6.82 5 ounce sample pour into snifter at the Revolution release event held at the brewpub. 2018 release 13.8% ABV. Dark black amber pour, very nice aroma, bourbon, vanilla, wine, on the sweet side. Very smooth whiskey malt taste, vanilla as well, very well balanced. Extremely smooth and creamy mouth feel, very easy drinking. Overall excellent pour, outstanding!",4.51

V.S.O.J.,On draft at Revolution. Full pour. ,4.74
V.S.O.J.,"12oz can, snifter glass. Dark caramel brown body, one finger offwhite head, good retention, plenty of lacing. Looks like liquid butterscotch, opaque. Smell is massive bourbon and vanilla, a veritable depth charge of caramel, butterscotch, oak, vanillin, toffee to go along with a dose of sweet oaky whiskey. Damn. Flavour is a massive coalescence of all of the aforementioned aromas; it's literally everything you could ever want in a barleywine and amplified to 11. Yes, this one goes to 11. Mouthfeel is medium fuller bodied, lighter carbonation, smooth as silk, warming heat on the backend. It's delicious and massive. It brings all the boys to the yard, this one.",4.7
V.S.O.J.,"Tasted on draft two nights ago at a preview party, reviewing now from a can. Half a finger of quickly dissipating head over a thick caramel beer. Minimal lacing, thick legs when swirled. Brown sugar, leather, plum, rum-soaked Christmas cake on the nose. Boozy bourbon spice and vanilla enter on the palate, with port wine and candy apple. Just near the edge of syrupy in terms of thickness; mouth-coating but not a sugar bomb, thanks to ample bourbon heat. Absolutely world class.",4.68
V.S.O.J.,Canned 10/10/18; drank 10/19/18 @ the Yarchives. ,4.94
V.S.O.J.,"Everything I loved for years about Straight Jacket was made even better and more complex in V.S.O.J. In a year where Revolution brought their A-game in the deep wood series, V.S.O.J. stood out from the rest! The booze and wood mingling with the barley and sweet dark fruit seemed destined for each other. Somewhat syrupy in the texture, but thick and richly so.",4.75

The Broken Truck,What has become a standard to which others are compared for American Wild Ale. Too bad it's so limited as it should be enjoyed by all. A world class beer.,4.5
The Broken Truck,"Bottled 1/19 - beautiful straw color, thin cream head hangs out. Smells like citrus and bread, tastes similar with a lot of complexity. Really easy to drink with medium tartness. Love it",4.84
The Broken Truck,Almost a full 5! Extremely complex with all kinds of fruit/spice/earth. No adjunct beer but lots of aging in barrels. Bravo! Enjoyed a bottle at the brewery in tillamook. 2019 vintage!,4.85
The Broken Truck,"Batch 5, bottled January, 2019, drank over two nights in September, 2019 first from a Hill Farmstead stemmed wineglass, then from a Tree House Teku.",4.35
The Broken Truck,"This one pours a slightly hazy golden yellow color, with a small head, and not much lacing.",4.65
The Broken Truck,"for how hyped up this particular one is, it is nowhere near my favorite beer from de garde so far, and frankly nowhere near the objective best, if thats not nitpicking at this point (all of them being so fantastic). i love the story of this, but from the bottle, it didnt blow me away to the extent that some of their others have, especially some of the fruited ones. its really sour, more acidic than i remember most of them being, and that slows down drinkability a bit for sure, even with the amazing carbonation, soft round mouthfeel, and relative dryness to finish, its still just a slow sipper for me, which is probably how lambic should be anyway, but its sour enough to be harsh in the belly, and thats over the line for my preferences. perhaps this is a product of it being in the bottle too long, being a lambic type i was in no rush to open it, but not all of these age favorably apparently. the yeast profile under the acid is fantastic, musty bretty and funky, with distinct juicy fruitiness to it, white wine, apricots, even ripe pears, its rustic and interesting, but with the acid its pretty aggressive. the oak is sturdy here too, grounding and dense all the way through which i really like, it seems sort of oddly hoppy, like they definitely didnt use hops aged down to zero alpha acid, and if they did, there are some weird organic compounds in the mix here somehow. its got like a fruity linger in the finish i dont normally associate with the style. despite the developed brett and heavy wood, this doesnt seem as mature to me as i would have expected for something modeled on gueuze with the different vintages in the blend, less of the iodine medicinal character than the old world ones bring, and less of the hayloft agricultural harvest rustic character, this is almost too refined to fit that bill, not a criticism just a commentary. i think id like it more if the sourness were less, and dont get me wrong i still love it, but i would take a great many of their other beers before i took this one in a hypothetical draft of their best beers. always a treat to have their stuff though, and i can safely cross off this bucket list brew for now...",4.46
The Broken Truck,Batch 4. Bottled 1/18.,4.39
The Broken Truck,"This bottle came out of left field - a tremendous and very welcome surprise. One of the newer members of our share group is a form member of the Urban Family team and has a deep selection of brewery bottles and west coast stuff - including, apparently, this specific bottle.",4.71
The Broken Truck,"04/2016 - This is a superb American representation of a gueuze; incredible minerality on the nose, plus funk, barnyard, oak; the palate is lightly creamy, funky, earthy, and a touch of lemon zest; so excited to see how this matures!",4.65
The Broken Truck,Hazy pineapple juice yellow with a large fuzzy white froth that dies quickly to a lightly spotty film.,4.12
The Broken Truck,"B3. Massive oak, funk, tart, acidic, rustic lambic/gueuze. Dark golden oaky appearance, long lasting head, and delicate lacing. Lemon and grapefruit rind lingers on the palate. Full bodied acidic mouth feel. So satisfying!",4.94
The Broken Truck,"Rating is for B1 poured 8 Wow didn't think this was going to live up to the hype, but I thought it was geuzey, rich, acidic, but not over the top. Had some citrus qualities. For the price I think DDG B2 is still a better get but I think if it was straight up I would take this. Great american styled geuze, lambic. One of a kind.",4.79
The Broken Truck,"Batch 3 poured into de Garde shooter glass. Pours semi clear with minimal head that dissipates quick. Aroma is funk and oak. Flavor is an explosion of funk and oak...lots of barrel in this yet so perfectly balanced. Feel is high carb, light on the palate. Champagne like. Overall, outstanding wild ale. Funky, tart and oaky.",4.59
The Broken Truck,Batch 3 poured from a 750mL bottle into a De Garde snifter. Thanks Ryan for sharing this bottle!,4.59
The Broken Truck,"Shockingly tasty - I know it's very highly rated, but for some reason I just didn't trust it to be as good as it was. Very easy drinking with a wonderful overall flavor. Probably my favorite de Garde to date.",4.56
The Broken Truck,"Batch 2 is a delicious beer with just the right amount of sour, funk, and barrel presence... pillowy and light but with a nice full mouthfeel.... very balanced with complex flavors that keep coming for minutes after you swallow.... worthy of the hype!",4.6
The Broken Truck,"Light orange color with no head. Intense aroma. Tart with stone fruit, lemon, oak, green apple. Apple becomes more pronounced on the taste as it warms. Aggressive oak barrel, tannins, and lactic acid. Grapefruit, lemon. Mouth feel is medium to full. It's a little too acidic to be elite, but this is a fantastic beer. It reminds me of a lot of side project beers because it is so intense and sour.",4.57
The Broken Truck,Batch 2,4.72
The Broken Truck,Thanks to my buddy Mat for tracking this down and sharing! This was Batch 1 and it didn't disappoint! Tons of juicy tart fruit! Would love to try batch 2 as well!,4.91
The Broken Truck,Pours a nice golden lemony yellow with a nice 1 inch head in the snifter. Smells of lemony rind with a nice funky sour smell. Taste is like the smell with a nice smooth tartness and a wonderful oak barrel finish. A awesome beer.,4.88
The Broken Truck,B2. This is De Garde's masterpiece and probably the best American lambic out there. Taut and fruitier than most Belgian gueuezes without fruit. Slightly funky and sure to age with grace. Wish I had B1 now since most are saying it is better.,4.75
The Broken Truck,The more I look back on this beer the more I love it. It was probably one of the most complex beers I've ever had. Perfect amount of funk and taste. The aftertaste sits with you for a long time. I had no. 2. It was very delicious.,4.98
The Broken Truck,"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2017, blue session. Blend 3. Aroma is quite funky with overripe peach and farmhouse notes. Taste is dry, funky with aspirin notes. Light, effervescent body. I also had a sample from the second batch a year ago and it was pretty much the same. I still don't understand why it's so highly regarded. Many other de Garde beers are much better.",3.75
The Broken Truck,"Batch 1, poured from the bottle into a taster. Huge barnyard funkiness with a bit of nuttiness. Great gueuze style beer while remaining distinctively de Garde.",4.92
The Broken Truck,"L: Rich lemon, sunshine, and caramel hued tones with an ample white foamy head",4.93
Abricot Du Fermier,"Hazy orange body with tons of funk on the nose. Some tartness, but not too much. Delicious funky flavor that you only get biting into an apricot, just perfect.",4.93
Abricot Du Fermier,"The beer pours a hazy straw yellow with a moderate white head, it has medium carbonation. It smells of apricots, nectarines, and red wine. The beer is tart, with big apricot, juicy nectarines, red wine, and oak. The beer is multi layered, and very juicy. An excellent saison from Side Project.",4.79
Abricot Du Fermier,"This is the best sour saison I have ever had. Not even up for debate. The apricot is the perfect star for all of the delicately balanced flavors in the original. Has a bit of wine dryness to go with the sour and smooth tartness that really made the mouthfeel just mind-bendingly good. Rich, complex, smooth and acidic.",4.75
Abricot Du Fermier,"Another superb SP fruited sour - eff yes! Awesome apricot, peach abound; yet not acidic whatsoever; nice tartness in the back of the palate; creamy, slightly sweet, and just crushable AF.",4.46
Abricot Du Fermier,Poured from a 750mL bottle into a SP stemmed wine glass. ,4.59
Abricot Du Fermier,"Pours a beautiful golden - surprising clarity, I'd expected more yeast suspension. Immediately after popping the cap, apricot permeated the air - it has a tremendous nose, clean and tart and fruity. The taste follows suit - tart, sour, full of apricots. Rich, yet not the yeasty beast that I had anticipated. Finish is fairly clean as well, which is surprised me a bit. This is quite likely one of my top 3 beers from Side Project at this point - I'd gladly trade for more any day!",4.75
Abricot Du Fermier,750 ml poured into a teku at a share. ,4.52
Abricot Du Fermier,Blend #3.,4.15
Abricot Du Fermier,"this is really good, no doubt about it, but not as good as they say it is i dont reckon, and once again a side project beer doesnt quite live up to its hype. their culture has trended super sour lately, and this is another expression of that, just really acidic beer, complex still, still lots of nuance, bretty funk and oak and all, but its the bacterial intensity that takes over this one and makes it a hard large bottle to drink, even split a couple of ways. i really like to let these types of beers warm up a little bit, but not here, its best when its colder, with temperature comes acidic intensity thats hard on the teeth and belly. i like all the apricot of course, about as natural as it gets, super ripe and even soft and fuzzy like the real fruit, very forward and incredibly natural and delicious, the authenticity is through the roof. i kind of wanted to taste more of the wine in the barrel profile, which is tannic and heavily oaky, but not as red wine forward as i might have thought for cabernet. all the wood is nice, subtle vanilla and even white tea somehow, killer with the apricots, peach juice notes, even green apple and white grape wrapped up in here, lots going on, but instead of mellowing into a slow tart bretty funkiness like i wish it did, the sourness cranks and disrupts the delicate beauty, it finishes harsh and big. i mean, in all respects this is great beer, but it just doesnt stand with the best wild beers in the world to my palate, maybe those who prefer a more assertive acidity will disagree, but i think its a little too much, unflattering to the fruit, and at $45 a bottle it just doesnt do it for me...",4.39
Abricot Du Fermier,"Pours a beautiful straw - light orange color. Pitch white frothy head which dissipates fairly quickly leaving a sudsy ring around the glass. Nose is ripe apricot, stone fruit, prickly pear, getting some oak, barnyard funk, bready yeast. Taste. Taste is follows the nose, getting apricots, green apple, lemon, a little grassy note. Tart, but not puckering. Acidic, but not harsh. Great smooth pillowy mouthfeel. Soft on the palate. Overall a fantastic fruited Saison. Everything you would want, very well balanced.",4.59
Abricot Du Fermier,"Abricot Du Fermier, Batch #3, is beautiful. It's what you hope for based on its name. Glowing bright yellow, smooth and even soft looking. A fluffy white cloud is perched above the bright sunshine from below, and it's making me thirsty.",4.53
Abricot Du Fermier,Nice sour qualities but on par with a lot of apricot sours. I dig the white wine barrel qualities. Quite full feel for a wild ale. Nice overall but nothing mind blowing particularly for the hype surrounding this one. As this warms the sour qualities become quite abrasive. Glad I split this between 4.,4.21
Abricot Du Fermier,"Super vibrant orange, almost neon, with a persistent lumpy off-white foam that settles to a thick collar and thin film.",4.02
Abricot Du Fermier,Had this on tap last weekend at the cellar- look and feel were both light and great for the style. Smell was good but not overwhelming. The taste was off the charts incredible. The best sour I've ever had.,4.84
Abricot Du Fermier,"poured from a 750mL bottle into an oversized snifter. pours a hazy and bubbly orange with fluffy bright white head, which eventually dissipates leaving a nice foam collar around the glass. some off-white swirls remain throughout the pour. smells of fresh sliced apricot, oak, wine and a hint of vanilla. it’s all there and combines for an amazing aroma but the fruit is the star here. the barrels give it more complexity than it would have otherwise but it’s very fruit forward. taste is basically dominated by fruit, however, the barrel characteristics are more noticeable than on the nose. it’s sour but it’s also refreshing. borders on light and heavy as it starts off lighter, simple and more refreshing but gets heavier and more complex as it lingers on the tongue and finishes. feel is smooth and full with an oaky dryness on the finish. overall, this is my favorite fruited fermier as i feel like apricot works so well with sour beer. the combination of the base beer along with red wine barrels and apricots is exquisite. this one probably doesn’t show the balance that some of the other fruited fermiers have (Pêche and Kriek come to mind) but i don’t mind that at all as this allows the apricots to shine with just enough backup from the extended-aged base SdF.",4.71
Abricot Du Fermier,"Batch 2, poured into a taster. Funky apricots and oak, soft mouthfeel, nice tartness without being super acidic. One of my favorite Side Project offerings to date!",4.69
Abricot Du Fermier,Pours a orangish opaque color with a small white head. Smells of funky sour apricots. Taste is very acidic and tart with a pungent sour finish. A realmouth puckered. But in a great way. Wonderful thick mouthfeel.,4.85
Abricot Du Fermier,"B2, Had this side by side with 30 other tremendous apricot sours and saisons. It was a damn good beer but i liked La Fosse better and Westly. Maybe it was more apricotty fresh but it was tart and good, but didn't blow me out of the water either.",4.26
Abricot Du Fermier,batch 2 drank on 5/13/2017 at dld,4.75
Abricot Du Fermier,"Combined notes for Batch 1 and Batch 2. Really nice apricot notes and a bit creamy. Batch 2 was a bit too acidic for my taste, though I'm fairly sensitive to that. As with Fou Foune, would prefer to drink this one as fresh as possible to avoid too much acid buildup.",4.5
Abricot Du Fermier,Bottle: Poured alight peachy color ale with a bubbly head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of light apricot and tart notes is pretty refreshing and pleasant. Taste is a nice mix of tart notes with some fresh apricot notes and a white wine-like finish. Body is about average with good carbonation. Acidity level is kept at a reasonable level. Very refreshing with solid mix of complexity.,4.22
Abricot Du Fermier,Some of Side Projects finest! Had this along side Westly and it was every bit as good IMO! Purchased this bottle along with many others of its caliber for a small group tasting and it was definitely one of the stars!,4.71
Abricot Du Fermier,"Really fruity and creamy smell, taste is soft, delicate, creamy, little sweet and most of all really fruity. Apricots all the way. To me, this is even more fruity than Fou Foune, I really like this beer.",4.9
Abricot Du Fermier,"A: Hazy golden color with a little bit of head. How a barrel aged saison should look. S: From the smell alone I knew this was going to be the best beer of the night. So much apricot, funk, and just a hint of tart. T: Now I've heard this thing is super sour, when it is chilled, it's all fruit and heavy doze of funk. As it warmed, it got sour, not as sour as the La Fosse, but more so than the PN3. M: Medium to full, probably one of the better mouthfeels on a saison that I've had. O: This beer was superb. Cory is making stellar beer. This one was the star of my apricot/peach sour tasting. I'm a huge Hill Farm fan, Side Project to me is right up there with them.",5
Abricot Du Fermier,"Easily the best apricot sour I've had. So much fruit and balanced acidity. It works incredibly well. Hard to believe this is 8%. Great offering, wish I had more",4.85

Alter Ego,"The can pour is a densely cloudy crayon yellow. The effervescent cap is very fine. The aroma is strong with pineapple, strawberry and mango. Mango, orange and some grapefruit are large in the flavor. There is significant hop burn, but this is okay. The mouthfeel is very smooth nonetheless. This is a superb NEIPA.",4.41
Alter Ego,"Really good, probably the best New England style IPA I have had. Juicy, citrusy, tangy, fruity, smooth, and enough bitterness to not be sweet, an awesome beer all the way around. Often I don't like mosaic, but this is great. I hate to jump on the hype train because that's not what I do, but this beer is simply awesome.",4.64
Alter Ego,"Looks like a murky glass of white grapefruit juice with two fingers of pillowy, off white head sitting on top of it. The smell is simply grapefruit, sweet malt and pine.

Alter Ego,"This beer pours an opaque amber/gold, with a frothy head. The smell is subtle compared to the burst of flavors one notices when sipping this beer. As mentioned, the taste has a whole host of flavors, including melon, pine, and a burst of various citrus fruits. This beer really hides the high alcohol content with some many different flavors.",4.74

Alter Ego,"Alter Ego pours thicker than expect burnt orange color with a great cloudy, with a 1-finger head that loves to linger with some excellent lacing retention. The smell is sweet malt with juicy pineapple and grapefruit up front with a bit of stone fruit and mango.

There's a candied sweetness midway through the swallow that helps to balance the flavor.",4.48

Saison Du Fermier,"This is the best Saison I've ever had. Pours golden with a white head. Great carbonation and mouthfeel. Tastes a bit like cider with hay, farmhouse, and citrus.",4.86
Saison Du Fermier,"Just another example of Side Project leading the way in American wild ale production. This is b2, and it’s lightly carbed with rich hay, grain, funk and citrus flavors. All blended meticulously with some kick from the wine barrel at the finish. Outstanding.",4.75

Saison Du Fermier,Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy golden color capped by a one finger head of foam; scattered lacing,4.45
Saison Du Fermier,"Poured into a goblet. A bright yellow golden hazy beer with a medium white head. Aromas of hay, straw, lemons, and oranges. A hint of funk as well. Tart on the palate and mouth watering. More delicious with each sip. Great lemon and orange citrus mixed with hay, earthy notes, and a gentle funk. Dry and clean Easy drinking. Outstanding.",4.54
Saison Du Fermier,"Simplistic beauty is how I would describe this beer. The sour, funk, grain and sweet notes all are perfectly balanced with one another. Smell is oak sour with slight yeast funk, with accents of orange, lemon, vanilla, faint white wine, and caramel apple. Taste is taking all of the elements of the smell and putting them through an oaken filter, causing a delicate blend of flavor. Wish there was a little more potency there. Acidic sourness defines the finish.",4.35
Saison Du Fermier,"03/2015 - Another effing tasty beer from Side Project; lemon, funk, some barnyard, yeast aromas; effervescent, champagne, sweet, tart flavors on the palate; clean, crushable finish.",4.32
Saison Du Fermier,"The best beer of 2018 so far. Bottle from Mikkeller NYC. Nose is pure farmhouse w/ some acidity, apple, pear, and wet leather. The taste is perfect. There is subtle tart w/ funk and earth from the yeast and grains. The blend is perfect. The feel is amazing, a little heavier then the typical tart saison but goes w/ this offering perfectly. Well worth actively seeking out if you are a fan of saison or sour beer.",4.84
Saison Du Fermier,"Shimmering, lightly sparkling gold-amber with a moderate white fizzy foam that settles to a creamy ring and thin central film.",4.16
Saison Du Fermier,"b1. Slight gusher, but it just flooded the immediate area with floral and citrus aromas.

It's almost like sticking your head inside of a used wine barrel. ",4.44

Saison Du Fermier,"Pours a clear golden color with a white head. The aroma is relatively subdued. Little bit of funkiness and typical Saison aroma. The flavor is where this beer really shines. Absolutely exquisite says on with the perfect amount of tartness to balance it out and add that punch to each sip. Chardonnay notes come through very nicely. Mouth feel is as you would expect for a beer of this style. Overall, this may be the very best Saison I've ever had",4.74
Saison Du Fermier,Poured from a 750mL bottle into a side project long stem tulip. Thanks Ryan for sharing this. ,4.54

Saison Du Fermier,Batch 3,3.86
Saison Du Fermier,"Batch 3 shared at a tasting in Pittsburgh. I'm tempted to give this a 5. There's nothing even close within the style, honestly. In it's own class. Pours murky yellowish with some white fuzzy bubbles around the top. Aroma is beautiful brett funk, sweet malts, hay, must, dust, some more slight sweetness. Incredible. Flavor follows with what can only be described as perfect. There is the funky brett yeastiness, then there is just enough sweet malt backbone that makes it impossible to forget it's in your mouth. What I find lacking in Hill Farmstead saisons--great beers, they are--is the perfect malt sweet balance that I find in this behind the funk. Just beautiful. Super easy drinking, but not too light bodied, medium plus carbonation, and oh so good. Among the best beers I have ever had. Going to be hard to drink any other saison after this one. (4.93/5)",4.93
Saison Du Fermier,"Not sure I can agree with others on here -- this is nothing at all like Saison Bernice (which is not sour/tart at all), nor is it all that juicy. It's just flat out sour. Perhaps I had an odd bottle (b3), but the sour was so dominant that other flavors had to struggle their way through. I thought it was dramatically more sour than Pulling Nails, even. It's tasty, but so sour that I wouldn't say I enjoyed it a whole lot (and I do like sours).",4.28
Breakfast Stout,"On tap at Oak and Stone in a tulip sampler glass. Pours dark as dark can be and tastes the same. Layers of chocolate, roasted malt, and smoke. No overly sweet attempts to hide what this is. If you don't like this beer, then you don't like stouts.",4.12
Breakfast Stout,"Deep, dark brown, almost black in appearance. Creamy tan head.",4.91

Breakfast Stout,Look Amazingly rich black with a tan head,4.51
Breakfast Stout,"Founders Breakfast Stout is everything you could want in a Coffee Stout. The beer pours dark, rich, and creamy. The head is deep tan, foamy, and substantial. The feel is thick and satisfying. The taste is fabulous.. a strong, substantial top grade coffee balanced with luscious chocolate makes a bold statement. It is the finest beer I have ever tasted from a 12 ounce bottle. It is impossible to overstate how good this beer is. It is a world class production, and a gift from the gods. Founders Brewery performs a public service, bestowing this magnificent brew upon the masses. I keep it all year.. I make sure I never run out of this treasure.",4.87
Breakfast Stout,"Good color, no head. Clean and balanced with an extremely creamy texture and a strong coffee flavor. Overall a great, rich breakfast stout with wonderful hop balance.",4.07
Breakfast Stout,"What an amazing stout from Founders. The look is jet black, beautiful caramel toffee head, slowly dissipates. Rich, creamy, full bodied stout that has a great balance of malts, chocolate and coffee. It's a beautiful stout that would be perfect for a cool fall or winter night next to the campfire or on the patio. The Excellent coffee and chocolate notes. Pours very dark with a light tan head that dissipates quickly. Thick, rich mouthfeel, decadent almost dessert like. This is one of the best coffee stouts you’ll find anywhere. at 8.3 ABV it's well balanced and the alcohol is balanced and hidden well with the taste. I found that if you let it warm a little it really brings out the flavors and character of this beer. Very good and I highly recommend. Cheers!",4.73
Breakfast Stout,"Stout should pour with a strong head but this have me no head. A nice flavor with a good mix of hops, coffee, & chocolate, however, not a taste that is so exceptional like would appear from prior ratings.",3.87
Breakfast Stout,Finest of the local package stores and priced accordingly. Very strong aroma of coffee grains and strong dark chocolate. Pitch black brew. Fine beer. Few are as good as this. I try to get a 4 pack every now and then to mix in with my daily drivers. KBS also very good from Founders. Both are excellent. High ABV though. Keep it to a few,4.79
Breakfast Stout,"I was looking over all the ""wow""s in the reviews and wondering if it was good as advertised- and it was! Definitely a top dog among the coffee-flavored brews I've tried. Maybe a little too good, it's going down awfully fast... no hint of light comes through the black, and first sniff tells you about the taste.",4.62
Breakfast Stout,"Nice dark souls black with a caramel colored fluffy head, nice roast smell no chocolate smell, awesome chocolate hit with a little sweetness and a finish of bitterness, nice full body with light carbonation",4.18
Breakfast Stout,"It's delicious. Jet black in color, nice mouthfeel for a stout... syrupy and thick. Aroma is earthy, plenty of coffee, vanilla and malt present which carries through to the taste buds as well, zero hop, plenty of spice, mild bitterness and well restrained sweetness. It's complex but most of all, well balanced. My rating grade is just a shade under the CBS and KBS that Founders is well known for.",4.58
Breakfast Stout,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours pitch black with a tiny light brown head. Smells of coffee, very strongly. Tastes of coffee with slight chocolate, very creamy. Beer is full bodied yet easier to drink than it should be, decent carbonation. Overall, a superb beer.",4.41
Breakfast Stout,"Look: Black with some brown hues. Big, creamy brown head.",4.63

Breakfast Stout,"L: Jet black color, two finger brown head, excellent lacing, no visible carbonation.",4.49
Breakfast Stout,"Very dark, almost completely black but with very slight brown. Hits the nose with a lot of coffee, but noticeable chocolate. The taste wasn't what I expected. It's labeled as double chocolate, but the coffee taste comes out on top. Not necessarily a complaint. The chocolate is mainly in the aftertaste. Bitter, but not horribly so. The feel is a little thinner than I'd like, but thick enough to satisfy. Overall very good. For my tastes, it's easy drinking, but this style of beer is right up my alley. If you're used to lighter beers you'll want to sip and savor.",4.44
Breakfast Stout,355 mL Bottle. ABV 8.3%. ,4.46
Breakfast Stout,"The Genesis of KBS and CBS. How could it be bad? Just as advertised, you get the coffee and chocolate. Dark, delicious and some hops balls too. Founders is so bad-ass for a reason! Thumbs up!!",4.65
Breakfast Stout,This is going to be a great beer!,3.59
Breakfast Stout,"For a 12+% beer, I didn’t find it boozy. The strongly predominant flavor is that of a very good dark chocolate. A bit too “one note” for my taste, the chocolate overwhelmed anything else",4.33
Breakfast Stout,"Hmm this stout is excellent for the price, four pack for $10. Great taste, coffee, oatmeal and chocolate mold together nicely! May even taste better than the KBS! Founders CBS is good as well but the difference is not much! This is a winner brew!!",4.48
Sunday Brunch,"Look is a traditional porter, black with a tan head that leaves minimal lacing. Nose is all expected, coffee, cinnamon, and maple syrup. Get some bakers chocolate as well. Taste follows the nose. Feel is luscious, but not oil thick. Overall, a great porter! Sweet aspects that do not become cloying",4.47
Sunday Brunch,"Huge like Hulk when he borrowed Barry Bond’s “vitamin supplements.” Huge, I’m talking huge coffee flavors like a hungover Sunday at Starbucks. But this beer wasn’t brewed with Starbucks. This is quality hipster coffee like the dork that lives below you who rides a fixie with a handlebar mustache to work. The only thing Raul isn’t feeling is the sweet maple syrup (cause your boi ain’t into sweetness), but it’s still quality. Also, I wish the mouthfeel in the end was a lil more viscous. It’s not bad. It’s not Martha Hunt super model skinny, but I’d prefer if it was Ashley Graham large. ",4.29
Sunday Brunch,Poured into teku glass via bottle,4.57
Sunday Brunch,"Kane absolutely nailed this one. Silky smooth porter with abundant maple syrup, cinnamon and roasted malt flavor. Best porter that I've had, bar none.",4.63
Sunday Brunch,"The pour is black with mahogany colors on the edges, underneath a dense tan head. The first note on the nose is rich coffee - wow. This literally reminds me of brunch. There’s also a significant cinnamon component. I am now officially salivating.",4.6
Sunday Brunch,FINALLY!!!!,4.59
Sunday Brunch,"What truly surprises me about Sunday Brunch is, in spite of being a non barrel-aged beer, just how complex and layered it is. The coffee is smooth and lightly roasty. The maple isn't super forward but it adds body and subtle, excellent flavor - tasting quite natural, by the way. The beer has great body and drinks easily. I really like this one - I can't imagine drinking a whole bottle by myself, but definitely enjoyed sharing this one with friends.",4.5
Sunday Brunch,"On tap at Morris Tap and Grill in Randolph. Pours a jet black ebony hue with minimal frothing. Complex aroma replete with hints of chocolate, and cream. Good stuff. Recommended.",4.35
Sunday Brunch,"This beer lives up to the hype. All of the ingredients are discernible but aren't overpowering. Nice notes of maple, mocha, and cinnamon. Medium+ mouthfeel. Minimal booze. Awesome.",4.55
Sunday Brunch,"Pours a dark brown color. Tons of nice sweet coffee and cinnamon. Milk and dark chocolate, roasted Malta, cream, and light molasses and maple. Thick body and low carbonation, easy to drink.",4.49
Sunday Brunch,750ml bottle poured into a snifter,4.46
Sunday Brunch,"03/2015 - I've always a fan of this; awesome cinnamon and coffee, without either being overpowering, on the nose; lactose and vanilla ensure a nice sweetness on the palate; relatively thick body, especially for the style.",4.46
Sunday Brunch,"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Blue Session. Aroma has fresh roasted coffee beans, toasted malt and espresso notes. Taste has bittersweet coffee, cold brew and a fresh, roasty bitterness on the finish.",4.4
Sunday Brunch,"While placing the imperial porter at the end of any session makes a lot of sense when it comes to impact on the palate, as it's usually the strongest flavored beer of the day, coffee stouts can get in touch with out inner insomniac. But the imperial coffee porter of Kane Brewing is strong in its effects while carrying a caffeinated jolt; perfectly suited for pick-me-up and put-me-down of brunch.",4.52
Sunday Brunch,"750ml bottle thanks to Rick. Inky black pour, small beige head. Roast grains, coffee, cinnamon on the aroma. Taste brings a bit of ashy notes, more of the roast grains, mild coffee, cinnamon, french toast without the syrup.",4
Sunday Brunch,The first whiff and sip of this beer is incredible. Cinnamon stands out most prominent over the nice coffee in the background. It's like a warm cinnabun. The only problem with this beer is it's quite sweet and it starts to take its toll if you have a whole glass. nb,4.25
Sunday Brunch,Pitch black with a think mocha head. Rich milk chocolate and coffee with a hint of maple and a milkshake mouth feel. All the flavors were popping months after the release.,4.58
Sunday Brunch,"Smell was awesome. Nice cinnamon and maple. The initial flavor was what threw me. Almost like an apply flavor in the front, that melded into a maple bomb. Smelled great. Initial flavor not great. Back end flavor, decent",3.94
Sunday Brunch,"750ml bottle, served in a snifter glass. Pour is medium dark brownish/black body, one finger light reddish/brown head, good retention and bits of lacing. Smell is heavily roasted coffee bean, sort of slightly burnt in a way, milk chocolate, cinnamon, a bit of green pepper and espresso. A bit weird at first, I think the coffee and cinnamon combined to make it smell a bit burnt. Flavour is much better though, not a ton of maple syrup but neither is it too sweet. Cinnamon lingers the background throughout, perhaps contributing a slight green pepper, black coffee and dark fruit, a fair bit of milk chocolate and caramel. Mouthfeel is full bodied, thick and substantial, good carbonation and a smooth chocolate-forward finish. It kind of tastes like cinnamon sprinkled on chocolate frosting, in a good way.",4.35
Sunday Brunch,"Pours a rich chocolate black color that is impervious to light. 2 inch tan head quickly fades to a light brown ring around the glass. Cinnamon dominates the nose, followed swiftly by Maple and coffee. Cinnamon and maple also dominate upon first sip, coffee moves in afterward and smoothes out the finish. This is definitely a full-bodied beer, carbonation is minimal and perfect. Overall a delicious and flavorful beer, none of the flavors overwhelmed or dominate, they are perfectly mingled together.

West Ashley,"Sweet sour apricot nose on this one! Taste follows with a sour, tart apricot finish and swallow. The tartness lingers on tongue and grabs it. It has outstanding depth and decent feel.",4.29
West Ashley,"Pours a dense orange, quarter inch bubbly cap. Aroma is citrusy - I got my orange than apricot, though that is there as well. Palate has a great balance of tartness to the fruit notes - it isn’t super-lactic or puckering, but allows that orange & apricot to come through nicely with anchoring it with some tart funk. Finishes tart and crisp",4.69
West Ashley,"This bottle came to me by way of a BIF - I don't know exactly which batch it is, but the fruit is still rich and deeply present. The apricot notes are super ripe and pulpy. It's very sour, almost cheek-puckering. The fruit is still predominant, though the sourness is very forward. The pour is a lovely, light gold-yellow. It's just slightly transparent, more than you might expect of a saison.",4.66
West Ashley,Into a wine glass at a share. Amazingly clean. Soft nectarine and huge waves of apricot; everything from the pit to the flesh. Perfectly balanced tartness to compliment it.,4.53
West Ashley,"07/2015 - Amazing aromas of peach, apricot, acidic, funk; sweet, juicy, tart, peach, creamy flavors on the palate; funky, semisweet, millions of peaches all over the finish.",4.54

West Ashley,"The beer pours a Clear yellow with a medium white head. It has medium carbonation. The beer smells apricots, apples, floral, fresh cut grass, and funk. It tastes very tart, with apricots, apples, floral, and funk. The body is medium with a dry finish. A great wild ale from Sante Adairus.",4.47
West Ashley,Bottle is about 2.5 years old. ,4.55
West Ashley,"Pours a nice peach amber color. Aroma is tart, funky and stone fruit. Flavor is fantastic. Nice tartness with stone fruit sweet and sour on the finish. Has a nice body and overall a delicious beer.",4.67
West Ashley,"Pours pale hazy yellow, white thick frothy head. ",4.46
West Ashley,Cloudy straw appearance with slight white head. Mild sour fruity aroma. Taste is a moderate tart sour fruity that has little harshness at the end. A very pleasant sour.,4.44
West Ashley,"Frankly, this beer is too sour for me. However, taste, feel, and overall, I think thanks a great beer. When you taste this beer, you will taste a deep apricot funk",4.19
West Ashley,"Really hazy golden color with a bit of white foam. Aroma has lots of unripe apricots and lemony funk. Taste starts with tart, unripe apricots, stonefruit skin, acidic fruit juice, really dry finish. Light body, really dry, medium carbonation. Overall it's a great, fruity sour. Very refreshing and easy drinking.",4.5
West Ashley,batch 12 (we think) drank on 4/2/2017 side by side Westly,4.68
West Ashley,Had this on tap at the Churchills sour fest. Really nice bright color. Can smell the funk and the sour taste was great. The apricots weren't super strong but it was really sour.,4.52
West Ashley,"Bottle shared thanks to Maakun. Hazy pale golden with a white head. Notes of funk, minerals - salt, baking soda - peaches. Light tart and very complex. Medium body, medium carbonation and a tart, floral and fruity aftertaste.",4.5
West Ashley,"Color is hazy peach-orange with a minimal display of carbonation, maybe a thin blanket before dying to nothing.",3.93
West Ashley,"It looks and it smells beautiful, but it missed the bull's eye I was expecting. It's still a very good apricot sour, but I'd take Fou Foune over this any day.",4.24
West Ashley,"An overwhelming blast of apricot and oak up front. It's actually quite difficult to get past these two very distinctive aromas as they're very unapologetically in your face, but some subtle hints of lemon zest, barnyard funk, and milky caramel-like lactose surface with some time. Bretty notes of horseblanket and hay intensify as the brew gets even warmer.",4.8
West Ashley,"I'm not much for sours, but this was great. Not as tart as some other brews I've tried, which made it much more enjoyable fore me. Apricot came through well with that funk also.",4.26
West Ashley,Batch 12. Consumed 9/12/16.,4.64
West Ashley,"On tap at the source in Capitola. To me, this was basically Saison Bernice with apricots added, aged in oak. It is a pleasant combo. You have the base saison adding a full body, nice carbonation / effervescent mouthfeel, slight funk, lacto. This one is quite tart, but I wouldn't call it sour. The apricot addition wasn't that apparent in the nose, but it did round off and pair with the base saison and oak flavors very well. I was surprised to find out that this was aged in a pinot noir barrel, because I didn't pick up any specific presence, just oak really. It goes down with a significant tart bite, leaving your mouth dry and aftertaste of tart lemon, oak, and hint of apricot. I really enjoyed drinking this and would happily have again. But, jesus it was a pain to get over here from the peninsula and unfortunately that means it will be a long while since I enjoy some SARA treats again. Sante!",4.36

Black Gold,"2018 release. A moderately aggressive pour into a teku begrudgingly produces a finger of cocoa powder-colored head atop a pitch-black, but not super-thick, liquid. Oak, tannins, plum, bitter dark chocolate, bourbon booze, and pepper round out the nose. The front palate is very restrained but quickly blossoms, with warming bourbon spice, barrel wood, vanilla, and fudge. Intense barrel character that I love--strong, with a lot of whiskey character, but without a hot mid-palate. Modestly dry finish that leans back into the vinous notes and adds just a touch of smoke.",4.47

Black Gold,"Central Waters Black Gold BA Stout 2017, 13.2% ABV (as listed by taproom). Pours black with no head. Nose is bourbon, chocolate, and licorice. Taste follows, with moderate bitterness, and quite boozy. Decent mouthfeel, overall excellent. I've been hunting this whale for three years, and was a bit let-down. It was decent, but not as good as its reputation.",4
Black Gold,"GTFO with all these wildly overhyped reviews. This was to say the least overhyped, however it is not a bad beer by any stretch. Smell is sweet, chocolate, bourbon. Flavor is chocolate, raisins and bourbon. Body medium. Nice feel to it. Good carb. Overall smooth, but nothing stunning",4.25
Black Gold,"Smell: Intense amounts of fudge and barrel. Huge amounts of oak and dry wood. Vanilla, marshmallow, coconut, milk chocolate, oatmeal cookies, maple syrup, toasted coconut, dark roasted coffee.

Black Gold,"Shared a bomber at hotel before Anniversary party this year. poured into hotel cups and it coated the plastic! pitch black. nose was mellow but had a nice amount of molasses and chocolate fudge. The taste followed suit but added some complex malt roastyness and also some sweet barrel and vanilla flavors. The feel was the star of the show, thick and mouth coating with just the right bitterness to balance the dry finish. Overall this was a fantastic beer that I was happy I shared but would have loved to dome by myself.",4.69

Black Gold,2015 vintage; drank 12/11/15 @ Yuss Haus Mach II. ,4.57
Black Gold,"Black Gold had a phenomenal nose. It looks like a BA imperial stout should look and left a slight mocha-coloured ring around my goblet . The pour was medium thick - not motor oil thick. I wafted chocolate and vanilla and a strong barrel and boozy notes too. The taste follows much the same. This is a very barrel forward beer. The booze presence is strong but not overwhelming or off-putting because this is what you expect in a BA imperial stout. Chocolatey and laced with vanilla on the palate and a very sticky mouthfeel that keeps your lips together if you let some beer linger and warm in your mouth. Overall, as my dear friend, Amguerra305, and I concurred while sipping, this beer misses something and lacks the balance of a Bourbon County Brand Stout but it is, nonetheless, a very good BA stout.",4.41
Black Gold,"Pours a touch thin to what I am used to. Hardly any head with just a lingering dark khaki ring around the edge of the glass; slightest bit of light peeking through the edges. Smell is very booze and barrel forward with a hint of vanilla. Chocolate and roast on the back end. Taste is rather sweet up front followed by bourbon and oak on the back end. There also seems to be a hint of anise somewhere going on. The smell is definitely better than the the taste which is very good but not great. Feel is a tad carbonated yet light thick in body. Overall a very barrel forward beer that seems to lack something to bring it all together. Smell is spot on, taste needs something more; bourbon county esque with something missing.",4.41
Black Gold,"Yum. Dark chocolate, vanilla, charred oak, toasted marshmallow and coconut. Super dry and oaky. Lower sweetness balanced with bitterness and booze. Not even remotely cloying. Medium feel. Really good.",4.39

Black Gold,"Thanks to elkhunter for scoring this for me, great guy to trade with, my CW connection. ",3.77
Black Gold,"this is epic beer, its their anniversary stout aged an additional year in the bourbon barrels, three years total, and man is this mature. i am surprised that the barrel hasnt completely taken over the stout, i suppose its big enough to stand up, but i definitely expected it to be all bourbon. the roast and the chocolate in the stout are still very apparent, just incredibly mellow and well integrated now, cloaked in oak, and as robust as they ever were. profoundly flavorful beer, with heavy vanilla and wet oak, char, and a hint of root beer for whatever reason. dark fruit notes, chocolate syrup, and hot whiskey abound. i love the mouthfeel as much as anything, so huge and coating, syrupy but not too sugary, warming from the alcohol, comforting, lie a big hug on my insides, its wonderful stuff that seems to conjure images of the coldest darkest winter night and the coziest fire. central waters has done an amazing job with these barrel aged beers, especially the stouts, and this is the granddaddy of them all without question. apparently some variation year to year. this is all time! kind of the final evolution of the barrel aged imperial stout in my opinion.",4.49

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"11.2oz bottle bb 11.09.2023 (presumably one year old) poured into Trappist Rochefort chalice at just above fridge temp 11.3% ABV. The beer pours mostly bright medium brown in color with a never ending tan colored head building in the center from the nucleated glass. Fairly complete lacing and excellent retention. The aroma is faint with dark fruit and brown sugar. The taste is rich Belgian malt & candi sugar with a not quite tart cherry/dark fruit overtone. The finish is moderately bitter and fairly dry, balancing the initial heavy malt presence. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with above average carbonation. No hint of 11.3% ABV in the taste or aroma. Overall, very good. An absolute classic and absolutely well made, but the taste and aroma are lacking in this bottle. I guess I'll buy a few more and sample as we approach 2023 to see if it's more to my liking.",4.4

It’s a hell of a beer, like Spielberg has had a hell of a career. That being said, even the best are not without their (not duds) but just good, not great works.

Rich., smooth, multidimensional in flavor, complex in the Belgian Quad manner. Mouthfeel never goes anything but smooth and rich, but demands to be savored slowly. The best of Abbey ale flavor and complex notes. Sad when you drink your last one. Never dull, always remembered fondly. 5 all the way, no other rating will do for this style. A reference in Belgian Trappist Ales.",5
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Pours a very deep, dark mahogany, almost black, coloration with a large, foamy head. Smells of bready, caramel malt, toffee and dark fruits, with just a hint of chocolate, licorice and estery spice. Taste is a complex balance of rich, bready, caramel malt, toffee, brown sugar, chocolate, dark fruits: raisin, fig, plum, with lighter notes of chocolate, licorice and just a hint of vanilla and clove. Finishes bittersweet, with a light/medium bitterness and some caramel malt, dark fruits, licorice and clove lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and light/medium carbonation.",4.35
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Poured into snifter. Deep brown with a hint of red. One finger tan head. Nose of vanilla, caramel and dark fruit with a punch of booze. Taste followed the nose with the standard Belgian sweetness. High carbonation and medium light body. This is a delightful sipper.",4.35
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Incredible brown color and rocky, uneven head. Beautiful mix of scents including chocolate, spices, alcohol, and grain. Tastes just as astonishing as it smells only with a slight bitterness and delicacy. The fourth and fifth sips are gorgeously smooth.",4.87
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Look: people keep saying ""reddish brown"", but it's really mostly brown. Sediment at bottom",3.7
Trappistes Rochefort 10,BB 8/11/2021,4.48
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Pours chestnut with garnet highlights, topped by nearly an inch of coarse, khaki froth. Muted aroma smells of raisins, caramel, apples, alcohol, and perhaps the barest whiff of nutmeg or other indeterminate spices. Shimmering swaths of lacing coat the glass as the beer recedes.",4.15
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"What can I say other than, this is my all time favorite beer. The smell and taste are wonderful, I love the dark fruits! I’m still new to reviewing beer but I can say without a doubt this is top notch quality. The price is a little high but worth every penny. I recently bought a chalice just for this beer. It’s not too hard to find here in MN, but it sells quickly at my local shop.",5

Trappistes Rochefort 10,"When I first tried this it knocked my socks off. Then... after many brews of different styles I came back to it over and over. Hmm is it that good? Is it original? I've come to conclude that if Quads are not your style try it once. TR#10 is pretty good for style. If quads are your thing also try it once. After that you decide. Repeat years later. I've had so many bad quads that this is refreshing, but it is also not as life-changing as I thought my first time.",3.77
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"L- I'm not sure if I should have held up to the light. This bottle has rested immobile for two days, and poured carefully but it's poured with clumps of yeast sediment, now floating up and down. Otherwise it's very deep chestnut and cloudy. It poured with a fine 2cm pale tan head, topped with a small dollop of dark brown residue - more sediment. I realise the need to be bottle conditioned to get a beer like this, but just mention it as a caution to others who might wish to rest this really well, and pour reeeally slowly.",4.36
Trappistes Rochefort 10,Poured into a Tulip chilled from a 12 oz. bottle.,4.61
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Dark brown in color with a murky complexion. There's a fingernail of beige around two thirds of the rim and covering about half of the top. The aroma is of dark Belgian candy sugar and sweet, light malt. I'm tasting very sweet light Belgian malt, dark Belgian candy sugar, caramel, and marzipan. The mouth is moderately carbonated, dry, and offers a light warmth from the alcohol.",4.09
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"holy crap. alcohol almost undetectable at 11.3% abv. dark caramel, raisins, bread, figs, vanilla. well carbonated but head recedes quickly. warming. almost has an oak aged character to it. can’t believe it’s held up this well. has been refrigerated for most of the time.",4.24
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"I can justify the 5.0 rating since this is my reference standard. The best of the best for me. When I find a beer that beats it, I can go back and lower my score to 4.75. St Bernardus is a close second for me. I do love the Belgian quads for sure.",5
A Deal With The Devil,"05/2015 - Love the huge cognac aromas, raisin and plum, a slight maple, subtle hoppy aromas; sweet, honey, boozy, caramel, dank hops, and more plum and some tobacco too; chewy mouthfeel with flavors of raisin, tobacco, dark chocolate, and cognac lingering.",4.74
A Deal With The Devil,"Massive caramel and vanilla. Plenty of barrel. Not at all hot for the ABV. Creamy, sticky mouthfeel. Long, sweet finish. 2014 vintage, cognac seems to have fallen off a bit. Just a fantastic sipper!",4.78

Sweet dark fruits that hit the tongue on the front. Some booze burn. Finish doesn’t linger. Feel is medium bodied for the style. Overall, this is an amazing beer. I’m starting to enjoy barleywines more and this one is near the top of my list.",4.6

A Deal With The Devil,"Batch 2, pours brown into the glass, not overly thick, small lighter brown head on the top, 1/5"". Aroma and appearance both look and smell like cognac. Massive amount of fusel like alcohol waft from the glass. Wow, this is just like smelling rubbing alcohol.",2.93
A Deal With The Devil,"Batch 2. Poured form bottle into snifter. Dark amber color. Nose is caramel, cognac and raisins. The taste follows he nose. The cognac blends so perfectly here. The mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth. Overall this is the best barelywine I have had the opportunity to enjoy.",4.99
A Deal With The Devil,"This was poured into a snifter. The appearance was dark brown color with a slim one finger white to slight off white somewhat foamy head that dissipated within a light lacing. The smell was full of sweet darkened caramel boozy malt. The taste had a full boozy sweet caramel malty flavor. There is a slight boozy sweet caramel aftertaste that lead to sweet yet dry finish. On the palate, this sat about a medium to heavy on the body. I don’t mind the thickness on this beer - it’s a barleywine, it’s supposed to be this way. Boy, does this super smooth over my tongue. Overall, well, Gabe Fletcher, yeah dude, you knocked this one outa the park.",4.6
A Deal With The Devil,"Pours a lively mahogany hue with thin, tight, off-white band around the edges. Nose expresses smokey notes, molasses and brown sugar. Taste follows nose - sweet and cloying, but not in a bad way in theses circumstances and the cognac barrel (wood and spirits) comes forth in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium in body with an almost still carbonation and an oily texture. Overall, nothing short of amazing. I just wish the price point wasn't so dear.",4.22
A Deal With The Devil,Had 2014 version aged for 2 years 4 months. Very smooth and lots of taste. Had a smooth cognac barrel taste with no heat to it. Compares well to MOAS. Had a debate over which was better. Think I prefer Moas by a hair though I'd have to side by side to be sure.,4.45
A Deal With The Devil,"I am not always a big fan of barleywines, but this one absolutely knocked my socks off. Everything about this big boy is, paradoxically, in your face, and yet, very nuanced. Lots of candied molasses, toffee, caramel, drambuie, cognac, orange and lemon zest, kiwi, strawberry, dates, vanilla, oak, and even a touch of the kind of tartness one might find in a world class lambic. I paid around fifty for this bottle of Batch #1, and I've seen them selling on the internet for at least twice that (and it would still been well worth the experience.",5

F-W is the brewer i hate to love. i'm reduced to having to travel a bit, or capitalize on business trips south-of-my-border, to accrue product ... and oh those overly-precious individually-boxed bottles... of which i usually keep a full case piecemeal-ed, stocked and stored in the (guarded) cellar.",4.5
§ucaba,"Pours deep dark brown with fluffy white head. Snappy bite and bold hop - really nice for a barley wine. Boozy double barrel oak with hints of dark chocolate, vanilla and toasted coconut.",4.64
§ucaba,"I love this beer for its taste, particularly the ""candi sugar"" aspect. This beer has joined my small circle of favorites. While the style is officially listed as ""British Barleywine"", the taste is very similar IMO to a good barrel-aged quad, like the Weyerbacher ""Blasphemy"". It is frustrating that barrel-aged quads seem hard to find where I live (Connecticut).",4.65

Smooth lite velvety tongue coating; moderate minus carbonation; dry finish; medium almost full body; some warmth from 12.5%.

It's sweet but very subdued. taste follows with a starting brown sugar, caramel and molasses sweetness that slowly turns into bits of vanilla and a booze warmth. full-bodied and nice to drink with a bit of warming lingers for a minute, which is nice to contrast just how subdued everything is here. would like to find another to let sit for a year or two, really glad i decided to clean the fridge.",4.46

Overall, this really is a greatly integrated, well made and blended brew. Solid all the way around while introducing you to different aspects throughout, with great balance among them all. But as great as this is, I find it hard to rate. As I recognize these balances and great nuances, I can’t help but want more from it at each and every turn and would like something that is labelled as barrel aged to show more barrel presence. Even still, it’s a beautiful brew. 4.5",4.42

Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,"
Medium bodied with a dreamy creamy mouthfeel. It's certainly not hefty or chewy by any sense, but every sip sticks and lingers on top of your lips like a crazy possessive ex-GF with boundary issues. Low levels of soft but obstinate (in the sense of expression), carbonation persist until the end of the drinking experience. Can't wait to see how this changes over time.",4.64
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,"Poured into a snifter. A nearly opaque dark brown color with a thin tan head. The foam settled quickly but left a decent ring in the glass. Aroma was equal amounts of freshly ground cinnamon, coffee, and milk chocolate. The barrel was hiding on the nose but very present on the palate. The cinnamon and coffee blended perfectly with the barrel, and the chocolate serves as a backdrop for the adjuncts. A pleasure to drink. Maybe my all-time favorite cinnamon beer.",4.47
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,"The Bourbon Barrel Aged B-Bomb with coffee and Cinnamon (Abominable Snowman on label) is a truly outstanding beer.

Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,"A winter warmer? The base beer, which is really pretty similar, is called an American Strong... I’d call them both really big, nicely crafted barleywines. But of course none of that really matters at all, the bottom line is that this is a very fine beer. It’s quite pretty, with a very coffee tone that includes a robust crema head. The aroma is subtle but rich, dominated by caramel malts and cinnamon. The taste certainly does offer a warming-in-winter feeling, with comfort food notes of biscuity malts, spice and boozy coffee. It does lack a bit in the necessary balance of all these enjoyable flavors, which is a task best left to a couple more years in the bottle.",4.22

Pours black, probably around that 60/40 mix of black and dark brown in terms of where the SRM lies. Brown head, 1/3"". Aroma gave off a moderate amount of bourbon, not hot, a small amount of coffee and miniscule, albeit prolly the correct amount of cinnamon. The roasted malt was tucked away in the nose.",4.18
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,"2016 vintage - I lucked in to a few bottles of Fremont vintages while on a trip to Denver for Great American Beer Fest. I was just a bit ecstatic, as you might imagine.

Beyond Good And Evil,"Look is classic stout - poured with an opaque head left minimal lacing. Nose is of chocolate, roasted malts/coffee, maple syrup. Taste follows the nose. Very, very well balanced between roasted malts, maple syrup. additionally, get notes of coffee and bakers chocolate. Feel has a good viscosity. Coats the tounge but leaves the pallet easily. Overall, excellent stout. This is what I wish stouts were moving towards - not something cloyingly sweet. Taste would be near perfect if I was able to get barrel.",4.46
Beyond Good And Evil,"Quite sweet - maple tastes just a bit granular and overly saccharine. But, it tastes natural all the same. An odd conflicting mouth-experience.",4.08

Beyond Good And Evil,"The beer pours Pitch Black with a medium khaki head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of maple syrup, baker’s chocolate, molasses, caramel, and bourbon. It tastes of baker’s chcolate, maple syrup, molasses, caramel, with some bourbon heat. The feel is thick, but smooth on the back end. A good barrel aged stout from Hill Farmstead, pretty light on the maple.",4.49

HF just makes everything well and this is no exception.",4.6
Beyond Good And Evil,Fresh batch drank at dark lord day 2018. Really a special beer. The barreling is perfectly done here. The maple was strong but balanced at the same time. The base stout is simply fantastic and the sum of all parts was exquisite. Heck of a beer here.,4.66

It Was All A Dream,"Incredibly sweet, a straight up dessert beer for sure. It had delicious, intense coconut dominating the overall flavor profile. Mouthfeel was excellent, no complains at all. Only good in small quantities though, due to the cloying sweetness.",4.45
It Was All A Dream,"07/2017 - This is bananas - I love all the elements of this ale, such as the nose and palate being chock full of maple, coconut, and coffee without being overwhelming.

We began talking about the glass and they mentioned that they recently had a very succesful J. Wakefield event. I mentioned how I would have loved to have tried ""It was all a dream"". One of the owners said ""I have a bottle in the fridge if you'd like to try it"". i was blown away by the hospitality. The beer poured with creamy specs of coconut. The scent was off the hook with loads of maple and coconut shining through. It tasted like heaven in a bottle with even more coconut in the back end. Light mouthfeel for how heavy the beer was with a very light carbonation and very little head. Overall one of the best beers I've ever had.",4.86
It Was All A Dream,"Holy Mother of God!!! 2017 bomber poured into my treehouse tulip glass.... this is the bomb! I love coconut stouts, and literally bought every prop '13 i could find for a year---must've drank 15-20 of them, and until now, was my gold standard (although Snowed In was damned good). But this beer leaves all other coconut stouts in the dust--not only because it has incredible coconut flavors--it has floaties!--but also because of the intense berry flavor (raspberry mostly) that compliments the coconut so well, and then some coffee and a hint of chili peppers kicks in on the finish...WOW. ",5
Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th,2016 version poured into a snifter. There is a nice booziness in the aroma however it is more subdued in taste. I enjoy the mouthfeel a great deal. I was anticipating this being a little sweeter with less char and bitterness in the finish.,4.1

Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th,"I've kept this aging in the bottle about a year I think. It needed aging because it first tasted somewhat raw, not as good as the regular Plead the Fifth.",4.44
Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th,"Sweet hell. Like Karl Malone in the 4th quarter, this one delivers. Think of your darkest moment, think of your darkest fantasy, think of your darkest memory... and then bottle that in a 12 ouncer and Plead the 5th Barrel Aged is what you have. The most beautiful, the most visceral, the most wild moment of your life... Think and dream. And in this beverage, I do.",4.49

Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th,"02/2016 - vintage 2015 - a lot of brownie, fudge, nice tobacco notes, smooth bourbon on the nose; slightly sweet, a bit creamy too, rich chocolate, bourbon on the palate; the body is to be desired, but overall it's tasty.",4.46
Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th,"Pours a pitch black coloration with a tiny, fizzy head. Smells of dark chocolate, coffee and vanilla, with a lightly boozy bourbon note. Taste follows the nose, with strong notes of chocolate, coffee and vanilla and ligher notes of toffee, dark fruits, tobacco, charred oak, bourbon and a hint of a certain musty earthiness. Finishes with a light bitterness and booziness. Thick, creamy mouthfeel with a rich body and low carbonation. This is reasonably complex and quite well-balanced, although the barrel-character is not that much at the forefront. Still, all the different notes intermingle harmoniously without anything standing out too much. Remionds me a little of KBS, actually.",4.25
Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th,"12oz bottle with no date on it. Pours a viscous black with no head. Zero lacing. Boozey aroma with vanilla, molasses, caramel and chocolate syrup. The taste is the Bourbon up front followed by dark chocolate, roasted malts, earth, tobacco and espresso. Woody, Bourbon finish with some cocoa. About as much alcohol heat as expected. Very low carbonation with a mouthfeel that is slightly lighter than expected. Overall, a great variant of an already great RIS.",4.29

Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th,Appearance - Pours black with nice mocha colored head that lasts longer than expected settling to a rocky mountain with decent lacing.,4.61
Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th,"The hype out does the beer. I aged my bottle 3 years and love bb aged stouts but this was just... meh. Darkhorse Plead the Fifth is average and only becomes enjoyable after a year so I hoped this would do well with time. Got the flavors of dried fruits, raison, fig still had chocolate notes but the alcohol burn was still too present and not smooth. This one can't compete with Founder's Imperial stout or KBS or with Goose Island",4.13
Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th,Pours pitch black with quickly fading tan head.,4.25
Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th,"Opaque brown color with a soft tan head. Nice retention for the ABV. Aromas of whiskey, oak, vanilla, chocolate. The taste followed with a nice mix of the above flavors. Heavy on the bourbon but reasonably balanced. all in all, a great BA RIS.",4.24
Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th,"This was pretty good. Again, non-adjunct stout which is uncommon in today's market. The barrel aging brings out all of the notes in it. I wouldn't put it among the best stouts I've had but it's pretty solid.",4.46

Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th,"Pours black. Thin, short, brown head fades fast.",4.37
Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th,"Why this beer is on the 250 top list? Like all Dark Horse beers this is brewed horribly. No balance, hardly any bourbon, and no barrel flavor. Dark as night, dark fruity boozy smell but really no enjoyable flavor. Dark Horse is a disappointment every time. Licorice, tobacco, dark fruit flavors with harsh booziness. Slightly smoother than regular Plead the 5th but not smooth or tasty enough to belong in top 250. Witch's Hat Night Furies need to take its place.",2.55
Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead The 5th,Very dark appearance with a small tan head. Aroma is a molasses and bourbon that is a little sweet. The taste is a very nice molasses and bourbon without any alcohol taste. Very nice,4.54

Notorious Triple IPA,"10/2015 - huge hoppiness, tangerine, big malts, ethanol on the nose; dank, pine flavors pair nicely with more tangerine, orange zest; surprisingly dry, lightly bitter finish, with a touch of heat in the back. I like this more than Pliny the Younger for sure.",4.6
Notorious Triple IPA,"Taster and shot-ski at brewery. For a big triple IPA, it’s pretty smooth, almost seems harmless. Goes down very easy, hoppy, but not much evidence of the high ABV. Light golden, mild haze, small fluffy head. Here’s a beer you could drink until...you realized what you were drinking. Tasty.",4.19
Notorious Triple IPA,Had on tap. Just a luscious and delicious dipa. And extremely drinkable too! That 12 percent is dangerously unnoticeable amongst floral and citrus hops and the hazy and bready backbone of the beer. Just bursts off the palate,4.49
Notorious Triple IPA,Growler fill poured into a snifter.,4.97
Notorious Triple IPA,"Sweet Jeebus, this is one intense, delicious beer. It should come with a disclaimer as it's a barely wine disguised by a clean and beautiful golden body with a shit ton of hop aroma. Beer sugar like with a citrus hop bombardment, with a sweet then bitter feel. Rich with alcohol presence well established, but not overly fusel. ",4.68
Notorious Triple IPA,This pours a darker tan caramel color. I get a sweetish citrus aroma that's matched by the taste from each sip. Sweet sticky citrusy and smooth. Hides its abv well.,4.1

Notorious Triple IPA,"This beer is pretty damn difficult to distinguish between it and PTY. Seriously. For years now I've been just skipping the big line at the DIPA fest for PTY and just getting Notorious with no line, the beers are almost indistinguishable. ",4.74
Notorious Triple IPA,"A great looking IPA, nice clear orange with decent head. Smells of tropical fruit, grapefruit dank but a bit muted. Taste follows. Not sure if they sent a fresh keg to Shelton Festival, will have to revisit out west. But this fell short of they hype for me.",4.16
Notorious Triple IPA,L- pours a hazy orange color with a half inch head that dissipates fairly quickly.,4.86
Notorious Triple IPA,Coppenhagen Beer Fest Boston sample pour. This has been a want of mine for a while. It was really good. Huge and citrusy. Pithy and resiny but also had some pretty intense fruity hop notes. I often find Triple IPAs are too sweet and boozy; the structure of the beer is all off. This one bucks that trend.,4.43
Notorious Triple IPA,Beer comes in a deep gold to Amber.,4.56
Notorious Triple IPA,thanks mark. this is so good. dangerously smooth and drinkable. the heat is invisible and not syrupy. easy drinking. I am super impressed with this brew...esp since this is a tripleading ipa.,4.5
Notorious Triple IPA,"I received a crowler sent from my cousin. I was worried that because I was out of town and it has been quite warm by the time I got home the hops may have fallen off. My worries were eased as soon as I cracked the beer open . The smell instantly filled my nostrils. Lemon, citrus, floral, pure deliciousness. The crowler retained the carbonation well and I got a good amount of head. The taste ... amazing. Similar to the smell citrus and floral and not to bitter with just the right amount of sweetness. Overall and awesome beer. Hopefully I'll get to try it again one day.",4.7
Last Buffalo In The Park,"I have had a few of these through the years, always excellent but for whatever reason 2019 feels a bit boozy at the end, prior years loved the roasty grainy after taste. Still better than 90-95% of what is out there.",4.48
Last Buffalo In The Park,The look and mouthfeel of this beer are world class. ,3.63
Last Buffalo In The Park,"I love Last Snow. Unfortunately while in the Tampa area this past March there was none that I could find. This beeer is courtesy of my friend and BA icon @DoctorZombies. Thank you my friend. There is only one rason this beer does not get a 5 and that is because no beer is perfect. This is damn close.It may be a touch on the sweet side but it just works. Oh, if only I had a cellar full I would be giddy !",4.75
Last Buffalo In The Park,"Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is big, bold coconut right at the forefront. Vanilla bean quickly follows coconut. What happens next is a mixture of gift shop fudge, toffee and coffee and hearty stout malts, with notes of toffee, molasses, caramel, coffee and roasty, toasty, caramely malts charging through. There is a very light whiskey heat on the edge, but it melds into the background well. Flavor profile continues to push the coconut heavy narrative, with vanilla bean coming on second. Between the two, the onset is very sugary. The remainder of the flavor profile works its way back towards balanced by order of notes of toffee, caramel, molasses, coffee, and roasty, toasty malts. Whiskey starts to come on at the end to boil away some of the sugar. Whiskey melds in well, never coming off as hot or out of place. Mouth feel is thick with a grainy velvety texture that feels decadent each and every sip. Overall, boisterous with a lot going on, with coconut and vanilla bean at the helm. ",4.47
Last Buffalo In The Park,"Black in color with no light penetration. There’s a fingernail of beige around the rim and just a trace of it showing elsewhere. The aroma is of coconut and bourbon. I’m tasting an amazing melange of coconut, coffe, and bourbon. The mouth is oily, dry, and viscous.",4.29
Last Buffalo In The Park,"Pouring this from a 22 oz. bottle into a snulip glass, this beer pours out like a dark brewed coffee, with little wood like highlights running throughout. It forms a thin crown of bubbles that are khaki in color and dissipate quickly. 3.75",4.52
Last Buffalo In The Park,"A slick black color with a frothy brown head. These guys seem to make some of the most strongly smelling dark beers that I have ever had. Big notes of coffee, chocolate, and spices. The drinking starts smooth and silky upfront with tons of lush chocolate malts. A smooth flow that finishes ever so slightly bitter. The coffee falls on the subtle side but the highlight flavor is clearly the coconut. I love coconut and the flavor comes off spot on genuine. Additional notes of tannin, smoke, vanilla, brown sugar, caramel, cocoa powder, and smoke. The mouth feel is superb- full bodied with such a lush and silky feel. Not overly sweet and not terribly sticky but enough to still allow the flavors to linger nicely after each sip. A slight alcohol burn on the finish but otherwise the abv hides very well and it's really warming me up. ",4.57

Last Buffalo In The Park,I dont particularly like coconut so I should have no business drinking this beer. But I wanted to tick a top 250 and this was low hanging fruit.,3.36
Last Buffalo In The Park,Appearance - Pours black with a nice thick tan head lost of lacing around the glass.,4.59
Last Buffalo In The Park,"For a barrel aged offering this is pretty well balanced ... coconut flavor is front and center, and might be overpowering for some palates , but the barrel flavor also makes its presence known. Not overly sweet",4.31
Last Buffalo In The Park,A: The beer is nearly jet black in color—only slight traces of dark brown are visible near the edges of the glass. It poured with a short tan head that left a large patch of beige bubbles on the surface and a collar around the edge of the glass.,4.47

Mexican Brunch,"I've had this bottle on my wish list for a while - probably since the first time I tried Abraxas. I'd hoped it might be similar, or even better.",4.21
Mexican Brunch,"L - pours a surprisingly translucent brown coming out of the bottle, but settles into something much more opaque with dark cherry red fringes. I guess this is ""only"" a porter after all. Creamy, whipped cream tan head with some aggressively sticky lacing. Leaves a fine film on the edges of my glass. The head color is simply divine.",4.63

Mexican Brunch,Enjoyed at the Copenhagen Beer Fest. Reviewed from notes.,4.74
Mexican Brunch,There's a lot going on here and it's all good. To me chocolate stood out the most with cinnamon and coffee in the background. I was looking for a bit of spice but couldn't find it. A delicious beer but I think I prefer the simplicity of Morning Bell. nb,4.5
Mexican Brunch,"2017 vintage. Wow. This one is off the charts delicious! The head is modest but it is a beautiful deep dark brown with a small amount of khaki head that fades into a light ring around glass and patches of foam on the surface. I find the coffee and cinnamon are most prevalent on the nose but you get a hint of the chocolate. The flavor is just remarkable, coffee, cinnamon, chiles come through first, the maple and cacao are on the finish which is just smooth and delightful. Kane knocked this one out of the park.",4.66

Mexican Brunch,2017 release. Drank on 10/16/2017 out of belgian style tulip.,5
Mexican Brunch,Pours near-black with a mocha head. ,4.48
Mexican Brunch,Pours a touch thin but that is to be expected considering it is a porter. Sits cola brown and opaque in the glass with light khaki foam around the edge of the glass. At first the smell is lactose sweet but as it warms up you get some strong chocolate notes and just a hint of chili pepper. The smell did not prepare you for the explosion of taste when you finally sip it. Sweet chocolate on the front end with a sweet cinnamon Center. Not really any heat to speak of but there are some pepper notes. Not really any specific maple flavor but it is definitely sweet. It feels a touch watery but still has a modicum of body. Overall this beer is excellent. Tastes more like an Italian capuccino than a Mexican stout but I am not complaining.,4.48
Mexican Brunch,2017 vintage. Not a gusher.,4.55
Mexican Brunch,"2017 vintage. I won the lottery! Then we all got our money back! Kane is ridiculously awesome for doing that. For the record, 1 of my 5 bottles ended up with the surge problem. Still tested the same great taste.",4.77
Mexican Brunch,"this is a killer beer, quite deserving of its highly regarded status, and a pretty righteous use of maple syrup, but i think i just like their sunday brunch better. i lose quite a bit of the coffee roasted bitterness here to the spiciness of the chilis and the cinnamon. i mean, there is amazing balance between all the added ingredients here, and you can surely appreciate each element on its own as well as appreciate its contribution to the whole, dont get me wrong, but i liked the simplicity of the coffee and the maple too. the cocoa adds a nice bittering low end along with the roasted malt, and i get a unique floral honey thing in here too, odd in such a huge and flavorful and dark beer, but there it is. the cinnamon is warming with the alcohol, and the maple makes this wintery and cozy. its not overdone, but its awfully flavorful, and probably as close to the line with adjuncts as i like to get most of the time. still really maple forward, but not as driven by it as the sunday brunch is. cool beer, powerfully flavored, neat balance though, and smooth and rich to drink on. these guys have blown me away in limited exposure, i need to find a way to get more of their beers in me! as good as any of the more well known beers made in this style...",4.4
Mexican Brunch,Tap at Copenhagen beerfest,4.5
Mexican Brunch,"Very good beer! Very dark, light tan head. Smokey, coffee, chili aroma. taste was much better. Creamy cocoa-covered raisins with a hint of chili in the background. Not as good as Sunday Brunch, but not more than a step or two behind.",4.84
Mexican Brunch,"I had this on draught at the brewery. It was served in a goblet. It pours jet black with f full finger of beautiful, mocha-colored head and delicate lacing that coated the inside of the glass and didn't subside. The nose is sublime: milk chocolate, fresh coffee, and vanilla with a whiff of smoke and Mexican peppers. You can smell it from several feet away. The taste is magnificent. The first sensation is chili and cinnamon; it's bold but not overpowering. There follows roasted malt, chocolate, freshly-brewed coffee, and hints of vanilla and nuts. All of the tastes individually are delicious and they blend very well. The mouth feel is fairly viscous and creamy, with moderate carbonation, and you can feel the 9.2% ABV. Overall, Mexican Brunch lives up to its accolades. It has even more flavor than Sunday Brunch and is simply a delicious and fun beer to drink.",4.66
Mexican Brunch,"I'd heard the chatter about the 2017 gusher bottles--and holy hell I can't believe there was a full refund to purchasers even though testing showed there was no sign of infection, just some nucleation from the spices--but my bottle was cool as a cucumber and didn't even begin to fizzle up as I opened it.",4.51

Society & Solitude #5,"poured from a 12oz can into a willi becher pint glass. pours a hazy, milky orange with a thin layer of head. smells of grapefruit and a bit of pine. taste has strong grapefruit flavors with some piney bitterness to back it up. feel is heavy, lower carb and full. this really is alcoholic grapefruit juice in a can. it doesn’t get overly fruity though as the combination of hops compliment each other to a balanced and citrusy yet dank & resinous DIPA.",4.52

Taste hits the same notes as the aroma; lots of smooth tropical fruits with a touch of citrus and pineapple sharpness, finish leans lightly bitter. Mouthfeel is perfectly pillowy, medium bodied with moderate carbonation. This is an excellent beer, it's near perfectly balanced and super drinkable. I wish I had grabbed more than one growler.",4.66

Miami Madness,"On tap at Lulu's in Allston, MA.",4.39
Miami Madness,"Amazing how much fruit goes into this beer. Tastes a bit sour, but also sweet with loads of mango, guava, and passion fruit. This was tart, but not too acidic - an amazing balance of flavors. Love the bottle art as well.",4.63
Miami Madness,"Aroma doesn’t have too much working on it besides your typical citrus funk & dry yeast found in Berliners...taste has lots of bright guava, just the right level of tartness but just a little too much saccharine / sugar on the back palate",4.42

Miami Madness,"The beer pours a some what hazy gold with a thin white head that recedes immediately. It has medium low carbonation. The beer smells of orange, mango, guava, and passion fruit.

Miami Madness,This beer exceeded all my expectations. Last years batch. The nose is incredible on this.,4.91
Miami Madness,"Great Berliner, see little wrong with this one except it there is not much beer. It is a little tart but fruit takes over everything which for some people is a great thing. I wish there was a little bit more beer then a mango smoothy. Still crazy nose and great flavor though.",4.35

Miami Madness,"NOW we're talking!!! Poured this and honestly thought it was a hazy NE IPA. Absolutely beautiful to look at. Starburst orange color that just pops. Aroma is unreal....guava, mango and passion fruit galore. Taste is exactly as the nose....ALL THE FRUITS plus a side of tartness please!! Feel was spot on....dry yet refreshing. Could drink this ALL day!! Overall, this is THE BEST berliner I've ever tasted.",4.88
Miami Madness,"Wow, total mango quava delight. Barely any head or retention, but beautiful color(s) and fruity as can be on the nose and palate. I poured in three separate phases to enjoy the spectrum, clean first pour, clean with dreads second pour, and dread only third pour. Got to say I liked them all. Met the hype, and worth the hunt!",4.6
Miami Madness,5's across the board. No doubt about it. This blows all other Berliners I have tried right out of the water.,5

Miami Madness,"Tons of guava, unique but not my cup of tea. ",3.31
Miami Madness,"really well done berliner type with tropical fruit. its one of the better fruity berliners i have had, and one of the best uses of these fruits i have seen in any beer, and while i loved it, im not sure it ranks among the best beers i have ever had overall, and wasnt even my favorite beer from j wakefield, although its probably still deserving of most of its hype! doesnt look like much, orange and hazy, quite thick for a beer so low in alcohol. the aroma is shocking, intensely sour, acidic, mouthwatering, puckery, all of it. with the passion fruit leading the charge, but the other fruits quite authentic and obvious in the aroma as well, juicy and intense, really different from other beers, more and more fresh. the flavor matches the aroma, with a real intense fruity complexion, passion fruit and orange and mango for sure, all really alive and bold in here, but never too sweet. thats the brilliance i think, keeping it dry. it doesnt feel light to me though, lots of body and texture, and even the high acidity doesnt lighten it up much. surprised its so clean too, gone but the palate begs for another gulp as soon as it is swallowed. this is not a style i usually flock to, especially with these fruits, where more often than not its gimmick over quality. this is awesomely delicious, a leader in its class no doubt!",4.37

Miami Madness,"Wow, this beer is all over the board, in a great way. So much flavor to process. The mango and guava jump out, the balanced tartness keeps it refreshing. The aroma take a bit of a sweet cooked red onion aroma, but it's not unpleasant. This beer was a wakeup amid a small tasting. I'd call it a must-try.",4.43
Miami Madness,"Wow, my new favorite Berliner. This is a lovely combination of tropical fruit with the just the right amount of juice and pucker. Seek this out without hesitation. Perfect warm weather drinking.",4.75

Pirate Paradise,I hate this beer. I just paid $10 for 1 12 ounce bottle of it and that would be fine if it was great but I hate it! I usually love dark beer. Even in the summer I'm ordering whatever porter or stout is at the bar. This one is all wrong. It claims to be vanilla coconut. I dont taste either. It just taste like any other dark beer but with an awful hard to swallow bitterness. I'm so annoyed with this beer right now. If it hadn't cost $10 and if it was 13% alcohol (something I didn't realize until after I bought it) I'd have thrown it out already.,2.31

Pirate Paradise,S: seeet chocolate and coconut cream with a touch of rum,4.93
Pirate Paradise,"12oz bottle, served in a stemmed glass. Pours a thick, oily dark black body, one finger white head, short retention, not much in way of lacing. Smell is sweet rum, vanilla, sugarcane, milk chocolate, a bit of sweet coconut, cocoa. It's mildly boozy, but rum is more or less always that way. Flavour is chewy milk chocolate, cocoa, a bit of sweet and oily coconut, more milk chocolate, a smooth and extended run of rum throughout, with a smooth, mild vanilla sweetness lingering on the backend. Mainly it's vanilla and rum mingling together on the backend, which is rounded out by a slight cocoa-like bitterness. Mouthfeel is full bodied, substantial, lower but still appropriate carbonation, mildly boozy rum on the finish. A very good barrel-aged adjunct stout that isn't quite pastry stout level but it's an excellent stout in its own right. Probably one of the few rum barrel-aged stouts that I have really enjoyed. I do agree that this one is a step up above Bourbon Paradise as the rum seems to work better with the adjuncts than the bourbon.",4.49

Cutting Tiles (Mosaic),"It tastes like beer mixed with copious amounts of honey. A friend of mine drove all the way to Boston, snagged a bunch of Trillium beer, brought them back to CT, and a sampling we did do. I wish Cutting Tiles wasn't the first one I tried. It reminded me of drinking Dundee's Honey Brown Lager back in high school. I was tempted to ""accidentally"" spill my glass off his deck to avoid further punishment, but there were kids underneath playing laser tag, and I was afraid of spilling it on them. Imagine having to rescue them from a bee attack or a bear attack if they were laced in Cutting Tiles. I thoroughly enjoyed the other varieties, but the 4.5 point World Class reviews for this beer are completely misleading. I think the beer is just riding the coattails of Trillium's other quality recipes. I desperately want to blind taste test some users on this site. This beer is terrible. Save yourself the drive, buy a double Mosaic IPA that somehow tastes like a pilsner, and stir in about a half a cup of honey and there you go, Cutting Tiles. Also, if you like tea and honey, try tea and Cutting Tiles. Oh, and I heard they're partnering with General Mills to make Cutting Tiles Nut Cheerios. Honey Boo-Boo is changing her name to Cutting Tiles Boo-Boo.",1.36

Cutting Tiles (Mosaic),"Trillium is an impressive brewer and this beer is well developed but in my opinion not their best. Pipeworks has devised beers with honey far superior than Cutting Tiles/Artaic such as Sure Bet and even Spotted Puffer. Orange haze, decent head, underwhelming in flavor based on hype.

Blåbær Lambik,A 375ml bottle at Himmergiet of the 2015 Vintage. Poured into a mini wine glass.,4.72
Blåbær Lambik,"Pours a rich bluish, purple with healthy blueberry yogurt head. Bottom of cork and nose smells like spontaneous funk with minimal barnyard mustiness but with healthy blueberry aroma. Taste is young lambic citric acidic sourness with big tannic presence, a bit of lacto, and slight but real blueberry undertones. Mouthfeel is full but the finish is very bitter and dry. Overall, this is one of the best blueberry beers I've had but it's a difficult fruit to conquer. Age would tone down the bitterness and let the lambic base come around but would likely diminish the amazing nose and kill the fruit from the taste. Great beer but I prefer many of Cantillon's other offerings.",4.63

Blåbær Lambik,"Bottle. I believe it to be 2015. Poured a ruddy, muddy purple. Almost wine like. A purple/pink frothiness that sits atop the beer. Aroma promises a very sour aspect to the beer. Earth, vinegar, wood, and of course, a mixture of ripe perfumey blueberries and underripe, tart blueberries. The flavor was probably not as complex as other Cantillon beers I have had but it was surely impressive and flooring. It starts off very tart. A bright pop of sourness that has a balsamic quality folds into a display of woody blueberry wine. I loved how dry it finished. Each sip was better than the last as my palate adjusted to the potency of flavor. The body was light and the tartness lingered. Probably won't have this again so it was definitely a treat.",4.65

Blåbær Lambik,"2015 bottle pours a deep purple color with magenta and deep red as well. Beautiful color. Nose is quite funky. There's a hint of a lactic/yogurt type of funk and sour on the nose. Not getting the fruit on the nose, but blueberries aren't extremely pungent. The flavor is fairly acidic. There's a funky tannic quality that I assume comes from the fruit. It's not a perfect marriage between the base beer and the fruit. It closely approximates the overtly sour american wild ales. Not my favorite offering from the fruited Cantillon portfolio but also very unique to that end. A ""bottleshare"" beer in my opinion that can be tasted and discussed among friends rather than a full solo drinking experience.",3.89

The Rusty Nail,"Really enjoyed this one, lots of flavor and balance - the smokey-ness is only very light present. ",4.66
The Rusty Nail,"A: pitch black, dark brown head that lingers",4.69
The Rusty Nail,9/3/2018; well balanced -- as it warms the cinnamon and licorice start to dance nicely on the palate. Do not let the licorice scare you away -- Enjoy!,4.75
The Rusty Nail,"The beer pours Pitch Black with good lacing, and a medium beige head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of baker’s chocolate, molasses, peppermint, slight cinnamon, and bourbon barrel. The taste follows the nose. The feel is thick and flavorful, and very well balanced. This is a great barrel aged stout, thick and well balanced.",4.65
The Rusty Nail,"Black with half in tan head. Huge cinnamon nose, powdered sugar. Slight licorice. Taste follows the nose, sweet, cinnamon, licorice. Nutty and coffee notes at the end. Cherry once it warms. Bitter finish, somewhat dry at first though sweeter as it warms. Thick creamy mouthfeel. I'm having trouble getting over a note on the nose that reminds me of baby powder. This really holds the beer back for me. A solid brew nonetheless.",4.01
The Rusty Nail,"Half glass share, 2018 from the bottle. ",4.79
The Rusty Nail,"What an epic treat. Not indulgent, rather epic. The melange of tastes and aromas combined with the singularity of mouthfeel that only Fremont can coax out of a stout is unreal. ",4.46
The Rusty Nail,"Thick and rich, almost like drinking a port. Dark in color, very thick in mouthfeel and a highly boozy flavor. Delicious dessert beer to be shared among friends.",4.56
The Rusty Nail,2018 version on draft: aroma isn't much but it goes down so smooth and pleasantly sweet. Very good already. Can't wait to see how it ages and maybe grows that aroma little bit.,4.29

Pirate Bomb!,12 oz. bottle dated 7/7/19,4.51
Pirate Bomb!,"A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer topped by a small tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with no lacing. Based on the pour this one seems pretty low in carbonation,",4.75
Pirate Bomb!,"Pours pitch black, quite viscous and thick. Great chocolate aroma accented by some coffee and coconut. Tastes great. For 15%, it isn’t as sweet as I thought it would be. Loads of chocolate, sweet vanilla, light coffee, heat is light in the background, rum barrel aging works some coconut into the finish. Full bodied and delicious, a little pricy but worth trying once...",4.5
Pirate Bomb!,"Poured from a bottle into a stemmed tulip. Pours black with a decent brown head that fizzes away quickly. Mostly rum on the nose. Faint hints of chocolate. Even as it warms the taste is mostly rum, tobacco, leather. Some chocolate and very slight vanilla sweetness at the end. A subtle warmth from the chilies and a little harshness from the alcohol, which is steep. Light to medium body. Would like a bit more balance as the barrel overpowers a tad. Great if rum is your jam.",4.09
Pirate Bomb!,"look: Dark brown, cola highlights when held to light. Modest tan head with messy lacing.",4.71
Pirate Bomb!,"Bottled 7/22/19. Poured at 55 degrees. Dark brown rocky foam briefly sits atop black liquid; no cap retention; barely a thin ring; no lace; medium legs on swirl. Strong spicy green chillies, rum and chocolate; hot boozy exhale. Taste follows nose and add vanilla, oak and mild roast coffee in the middle; rum soaked chocolate Mexican cake finish. Silky feel, medium body, moderate minus carbonation; warming from 15% ABV. Overall super well balanced, lots of heat from the peppers and alcohol with plenty of chocolate and vanilla to round out the whole; and the nose/flavors stay strong from first sip to last. Worthy of the premium price paid.",4.7
Pirate Bomb!,(L) Pours pitch black with almost no head.,4.93
Pirate Bomb!,"Black, rich and Beautiful. Make Oprah proud. Smells delicious like liquor and chocolate. Sweetie. Licorice. That wonderful chili heat is smooth and away some tasty beverage. It'll make you lick your lips AND splash some up your nose inhaling it and another little sip. Holy Beer Hops! Right down the line. Got about a half full snifter. Mind Blown. Mouth feels it. I hear turbines spinning and I think we're about to go vertical very quickly. Clear the computer desk.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>",5
Pirate Bomb!,"Poured a black body with minimal khaki head that quickly died. Aroma has hints of vanilla and chocolate but mostly I get the chili/spicy peppers that hit me strong. Thick, sticky, chocolate sweetness with vanilla and boozy feel, a woody smoothness that belies it's thickness and coating on the tongue, and the spices/heat and booze do come out strong on the finish. A slow sipping and hot meal in a bottle.",4.18
Pirate Bomb!,"Bottled on 7/19/2019.Pours into a goblet jet jet black with a really thin deep mocha head that is gone as quick as it comes.Slight chili smoldering,roasted nuts,and dark chocolate in the nose.The massive complexity comes out in the flavors of the beer,that smoldering chili that is attached to a little smoke,chocolate,and vanilla tinged rum compliment that smoky chili element nearly perfectly,both intertwine in a lingering finish....Fantastic!I was mildly underwhelmed until I started drinking it,an awesome big stout worthy of ranking.",4.49
Pirate Bomb!,"Really a delicious BA stout, just a little too hot on the finish, wish it were maybe 12-13% ABV. Almost perfect though, nose and flavors are excellent.",4.93
Pirate Bomb!,"It looks thick and oily like all Prairie's great stouts. There's a little lacing that stays after the pour. The smell is getting me excited to taste it. It's relatively fresh with a 7/18/19 bottling date (today is 9/5.) I can smell a bit of the sweet bourbon character and I think a bit of the chillies. Otherwise it smells like standard Bomb (which is to mean that it smells great!) I just realized it has a 15% abv which means 12oz is probably a bit much for me on a weeknight, but it'll be worth it. ",4.58
Pirate Bomb!,Look and smell are undiscernabl3 from regular bomb. I'm getting no rum on the nose.,4.02
Pirate Bomb!,"Incredible imperial stout that lived up to its hype - found this gem at an out-of-state supermarket. Pours a deep, dark, rich opaque black color with a little tan head and spotty lingering lacing. Very nice. Deep, rich aromas of dark chocolate fudge, medium roast coffee, toasted nuts, coconut, caramel, creamy vanilla, rum, oak and malt. Taste follows the nose, with an outstanding balance between the heavier rich flavors and the creaminess that balanced it out. Coconut was pleasantly in the forefront (as opposed to the recent Pirate Noir beer that I tried). Could have used a little more rum, but was nonetheless delicious. Definitely a sipper, there was some upfront warming alcohol but it was very pleasant. Smooth, sticky, chewy mouthfeel that coated the palate. Just the right amount of carbonation. An excellent beer, one that I would seek out again.",4.38
Pirate Bomb!,L: Generic black color,4.23
Pirate Bomb!,"shame i have to work tomorrow. it's already open though. motor oil black mess in the glass, with a thin khaki head that kicked up from a heavy hand. a few strings stick behind. taking a whiff there's a lot of milk chocolate, vanilla, coconut and funk, and just a mixture of things that burn the nose a bit. a bit of old coffee and a more mellow rum heat as it warms up. a nice evolution. taste came off a bit heavy on the sweetness at first, lots of the original bomb sings through here with a rich chocolate, vanilla and malt-y profile that has slowly warmed into some wood-like notes with a splash of rum. chilis kind of get lost but maybe they just join in with the general residual heat. could be better balanced but when i pop a 15% brew i only expect so much in that department. sip it slower it than i am please. make some dessert. pet your dog. it's a good beer and on par with prairie for me, tasty but wish i'd paid a buck or two less. cheers",4.27
Pirate Bomb!,"This is a wonderfully big stout! Vibrantly flavorful: dark chocolate, coffee, dark berries, red wine, oak, some smoke, cinnamon and vanilla. A comforting amount of booze.",4.58

Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"September 3rd, 2015 - The Alesmith Vietnamese Coffee stout is a premier beer, but the Bourbon Barrel Aged version is no slouch. With a smooth, opalescent look it offers classic and classy alcohol and oak notes, smoldering with ethanol. The taste is much gentler, both sweet and delicate, but also bold and robust. A licorice sweetness mixes with the taste of Japanese whisky, and a thinner palate let's everything shine through.",4.21
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"I'm a huge fan of Fremont's Barrel Aging Program, and even as Goose Island sold out, Bourbon County remains a brew to benchmark against. It is rare to meet a BA Stout of this caliber and this is exactly what we have with the BBA Speedway. It's good - better than BCBS on their off years. Maybe better than their best.",4.59
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,On tap at the brewery. Opaque dark chocolate color with a thin tan head. A nice barrel aroma along with some chocolate and coffee. The taste was as expected. Bright coffee up front followed by a hefty chocolate presence all wrapped in a bourbon blanket. Full bodied with a slick feel. Outstanding.,4.46

Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Tasted on tap at Ansari's Eagan, MN during Black Friday tap takeover. I tried this beer first and it was by far my favorite of the 4 sampled that afternoon.

Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"2018 vintage, on tap in a 10oz flute. Carbonation is subdued and the beer only has a very slight ring of dark brown head. Drank side by side with a Jamaican Speedway - these beers are quite easily distinguished in appearance and in taste, which surprised me a bit. I've had quite a few of the Speedway variants now and they all have their own very unique traits.",4.66
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,750ml bottle - 2015 vintage,4.83
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Tasted from 2013 bottle. Pours jet black with tan head. Not much head. Lots of caramel, molasses, maple, bourbon on the nose.

Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,2013 bottle now aged 4 years. ,4.02
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Description: Appearance is jet black, like the normal Speedway, with little to no head. Smell is full of oak but not so much bourbon. Coffee, dark chocolate and roasty notes are also apparent. The woodiness of the oak really comes through on the taste and adds a lot of earthiness to the beer. Taste is not as coffee heavy as the smell. Feel is more like a porter in that it's a little light for a stout. Minimal carbonation and smooth drinking.",4.42
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Black color with dark brown head. Aroma has slightly acidic coffee, even a bit green with some bourbon in the background. Taste is sweet at first, fudgy, continues with sweetened coffee and bourbon, a hint of green coffee bitterness on the finish. Full bodied, medium carbonation. Really nice variation of the base beer, adds a nice flavor complexity.",4.5
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Dark cola brown in the glass with bits of light coming through the edges. No head lingers in the glass but there was lovely carbonation at first. Barrel and coffee comes through in the most but the barrel is not super pronounced. Roast, slight chocolate and vanilla and booze is there but well balanced and dare I say hidden. Taste is somewhat sweet with a roasty middle and followed by a woodsy back end with the slightest bourbon bite. Feel is kind of thin especially for the style. It has slightly more carbonation than is usual for the style but barely any objectively speaking. Overall a great beer that is very well balanced but could use some more body. Not a coffee bomb at all.",4.56

Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"great looking brew. pungent notes of oak, booze, caramel on the nose. very sweet tasting - milk chocolate, caramel, toffee, vanilla, boozy bourbon, slightly bitter coffee & roasty malts giving some balance. mouthfeel is about where it should be but nothing exceptional in terms of texture. overall this was a very good barrel aged stout.",4.53
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"This beer pours thick and dark with an amazing brown head that fades after a minute or so but leaves a few globs of lacing behind. The aroma from this is heavenly. Tons of sweet, roasted malt with a massive amount of coffee and dark chocolate all with the most pleasant whiff of bourbon in the background. The taste is exactly the same as the aroma with the roasty twang of the malt being complimented by the coffee and chocolate and the bourbon coming in to bring it all together. This is as good as any BBA coffee stout I have had. It is a great beer.",4.96
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Pours a thick black color with a tan head and fresh lacing. Smell is bourbon vanilla wood roasted malt ans chocolate.

The Peach,"11/2015 - Batch 1 - Love when this warms - the cognac pops incredibly, the peach is lovely, and the funk takes a back seat; more peach, cognac, and barnyard on the palate, with some classic dG funk to round it out; pretty great body, with a lightly sweet, a touch acidic finish.",4.85
The Peach,"Batch 2, I think.",3.94
The Peach,"Something has to have been wrong with my bottle. Poured like jelly, little to no peach flavor, no carbonation. An overall strange experience for sure.",3.03

The Peach,"A wild ale's wild Ale. De Garde nailed it on this one. Appearance is a hazy opaque golden orange peach color, absolutely beautiful! This was B1 so the nose was in the face cognac from the moment the bottle was capped ... oh them barrels!! Flavor is big peach, with nice integrated Brandy tones, and the mouthfeel is as rich as a wild Ale can get. Home run with B1 de Garde!",5
The Peach,Bottle on-site at de Garde. This one was as advertised and maybe even better. One of the best fruited wild ales I have ever had. Nearly perfect in execution - incredible fruit flavor and just enough sourness. I liked this better than Nectarine Premiere.,4.75

Double Shot,"Pours a dark brown with tan head. It smells of intense coffee. No bitterness at all to this. Just fudgey chocolate and coffee. Smooth as hell. It's very approachable in the way that every Tree House is approachable. This no doubt tastes great and is super smooth, but it is also the type of coffee stout that people who don't drink coffee stouts would like. It's not super complex and has one note of those three flavors.",4.27
Double Shot,"Drank from a 500 ml (1 pt .9 fl. oz) bottle purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA",4.65
Double Shot,"Pours opaque, dark brown in color with 1/3 inch head. Taste is dark roast coffee, chocolate, and light vanilla. Heavy bodied, roasty with moderate carbonation. Solid coffee stout with plenty of coffee flavor. You can tell this is the base for their other sweet stout. Above average. Plenty of coffee taste for coffee drinkers.",3.83
Double Shot,"A- 500ml pours into a tulip glass with a tar black body and a deep brown, thick and creamy head. The cap makes it to just over a finger at its peak and has good retention. A few webs of lacing coat the glass.",4.43
Double Shot,"Just lucked out on being in the right place at right time as I was driving from Fl to Me. I honestly didn’t know that TH did stouts as I have only been at the new brewery one time before. I am so glad that I got this one. My fav beers are RIP’s, stouts and the dark styles and TH really hit a home run with this for me . This is OMG good. A wonderful blend of things that all work together beautifully. I only bought two bottles and now wish I had bought more as I am sipping it for the first time. Just had the second bottle, 8/31/19 and I liked even more than the first bottle. Had to kick my wife and dog out of a fully packed car to buy more. Just didn’t have a good feel to leaving my wife and dog at Tree House. Bummer.",4.46
Double Shot,"Traded for this and a few other bottles from Tree House this week, as I never had anything dark and heavy from them before. Although the Vanilla Bean take on this was better, this was a solid beer that felt like sensual coffee in a bottle. If you like your beer to be roasted, slick, and complemented by appropriate flavors, then you've found your match right here!",4.43
Double Shot,"Very pretty pour: thick, black, and fizzy, with a retentive chocolate brown head.",4.81

Double Shot,Pours black with two fingers mocha head that lasted for a bit.,4.47
Double Shot,"Pours black with two fingers of dense, caramel-colored foam. Head retention is good with good lacing left behind. Aroma is cocoa powder, toffee and dark chocolate with very faint medium-roast coffee. Malts are roasty and toasty and provide a fairly robust base. Flavor profile is cocoa powder, toffee, dark and milk chocolate, and medium-roast coffee. Malts hit notes of roasty, toasty, caramely, and bready. Sugary notes of milk and dark chocolate linger with balanced medium-roast coffee, and lightly bitter roasted malts for a lengthy period of time between sips. Flavor profile really exudes decadence, while the aroma is a little bit dry and forgettable in comparison. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a velvety, decadent texture. Overall, an intriguing beer with the aroma being faint and the flavor profile being stout and resolute. ",4.37

The white glowed against the midnight dark brown beer as if it were from Three Mile Island (the nuclear power plant, not the AMC summer camp). The current description suggests the Double Shot has been a project that has evolved. (from the website: These bottles represent the culmination of a coffee beer project nearly four years in the making. Double Shot, our beloved coffee stout, has been refined time and time again to achieve a beer that is both as robust in its base as it is a worthy purveyor of its respective coffee."")",4.06

Grey Monday,"2016 bottle. Pours black with beige head. Huge caramel, hazelnut and cocoa aroma. Taste is still a little boozy but good for its ridiculously high ABV. Lots of hazelnut on the flavor with molasses, caramel, butterscotch, cocoa, bourbon. Delicious huge beer. Definitely a sipper.",4.64

Grey Monday,"2017 vintage. Pours a deep mahogany with a tight band around the shoulders. Nose reveals hazelnut, cocoa, butterscotch and spirit/ethanol. Taste expresses butterscotch, cocoa, ethanol and a hint of soy sauce. Mouthfeel is fairly light with a lively carbonation. All and all - drinkable and ABV is dangerously well-hidden; however, I think another year in the cellar might be the sweetspot.",4.1
Grey Monday,"Pouring from a 2016 750 ml. bottle into a snifter. This beer pours out very light in color for the style, just like the rest of the series. Doesn't form a crown, only an outer ring of bubbles attaching themselves to the glass. The smell is big boozy raisins and plums with slight chocolate as well. This whole series has had huge dark fruit notes. It just smells like you're going to get drunk. The taste comes in hot with booze and the dark fruit remains. This is the version aged on hazelnuts, but honestly how would you ever know with a beer this boozy? I do think I like this one better than the rest, but they just still don't hold up to the caliber I thought they would bring.",4.21

Grey Monday,2017 bottle,4.52
Grey Monday,"In the interest of fairness, I am not a huge fan of hazelnut. There is something of putting about the overall profile. That said, at the front the thick boozing this is very apparent. Lingering about the mouth, the hazelnut was very easy to detect. The field was very sticky and sweet, swinging easily to the sides of the mouth. The feel was almost chewy. Raisins and dark fruit were also present. Yet in the overall scheme of things, the hazelnut make this hard for me to like.",4.08
Grey Monday,To me this tastes like a slightly smoother more chocolatey black tuesday. And I love black tuesday dont get me wrong but I dont think this one is worth the extra effort of chasing down compared to black tuesday. the wax smells amazing tho,4.54
Grey Monday,"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 10/4/2016. Pours nearly opaque dark brown/black color with a 1 finger foamy khaki head with poor retention, and reduces to nothing pretty quickly. Minimal spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Plenty of alcohol legs on the glass. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, hazelnuts, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, fudge, vanilla, molasses, bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, raisins, and roast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, hazelnuts, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Increasing booze in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, hazelnuts, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, fudge, vanilla, molasses, bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, raisins, and roast/oak earthiness. Light-moderate bourbon/oak spiciness and light roasted bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, hazelnuts, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, fudge, vanilla, molasses, bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, raisins, and roast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, hazelnuts, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light dryness from bourbon/oak spiciness and roast bitterness, lightly increasing through the glass. Light-medium carbonation and fairy full body; with a smooth, creamy/silky, and lightly slick/syrupy/sticky/chalky/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden; a small lingering warmth, with mild booziness lingering after the finish. Overall this is an incredible barrel aged imperial stout! All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, hazelnuts, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the enormous ABV. I was hoping for more intense hazelnut character from this; but it seems to be much more balanced between the malt, barrel, and hazelnut flavors. A highly enjoyable offering regardless.",4.3

Great,"Hazy bronze with a frothy, bubbly light khaki head, Great delivers smoky caramel and toffee with nutty marzipan, splintery oak, and pungent aged orange zest on top of an underlying toasted biscuit, all via a crisp bubbliness and a light but solid heat that rides along some peppery whiskey.",4.08

Great,"12/2017 - 2015 vintage - From what I heard, the 2013 vintage is way better than this; that said, this was good - solid bourbon, toffee, caramel, and some vanilla; thinner body than I'd expect from a barleywine.",4.29

Great,"Brown and dark amber pour, ultra thin lighter brown head. Aroma knocks substantial whiskey and brown malt notes all over it. Its boozy. But it blends well with the rest of the brown malt, brown sugar, maris otter and said booziness. ",4.13
Great,"Batch 1 bottle poured in a stemmed bulb. Pours a murky brown color. Minimal head that fades quick. Aromas of dates, raisins, plums, caramel and toffee. Taste is exactly as the aroma. Sweet dark fruits, caramel and toffee just coat the mouth. This is like drinking candy. Absolutely amazing. No booze. Feel is full bodied for the style. Overall, this is an amazing beer. Best barleywine I’ve had to date!",4.92

Great,"On tap at NC Rare 1/28/17. Caramel color. Smell was caramel, dark fruit, malts. Tasted more like an English barleywine. No hops at all. Mostly caramel, dates, raisin, mild barrel. Overall, this was a fantastic beer. The barrel was not overdone like a lot of BA barleywines.",4.6
Great,"Big, thick, and dark (there's a joke in there somewhere) are the only ways to describe this epic barleywine from Alpine! While overall I found it to be a touch too sweet, it's still a fantastic BA version of the style.",4.42

Great,"This is truly a ""great"" experience. I would not classify this as an American Barleywine, but an English one.

In Perpetuity,"appearance is pretty standard tree house haze with good carbonation. Aroma is citrus, and some dank ness. The taste is some orange, citrus zest, earthy hops, and a little Dankness rounding it out. Mouthfeel is also amazing, as per usual tree house. Creamy, slick, medium, but also a little light. Not thin, just very easy drinking with adequate carbonation. Overall this is very good, I’m in the 4.25 range",4.27

In Perpetuity,Nothing but solid goodness from Tree House. Citrus and tropical flavors are in balance. Nice hazy pour. Not very complex; just straight down the middle solid and enjoyable.,4.02
In Perpetuity,"Pours cloudy, bright gold with a dense white head with great spotty lacing. Aroma has nice orange blossom notes, so sweet and floral. Taste has a more pungent punch to it up front, a bit hot with stone fruit tang that settles i to a pleasant, more mellow citrus in the mid taste and finish. Feel is very soft but peppery and hot, especially in the aftertaste. This is just fantastic. Rich and tangy but with a solid backbone of citrus mellowness that keeps it balanced.",4.44

Orange, lemon, lime, grapefruit and some white wine as well. The taste is mostly the white wine along with some lemon and lime notes. A bit floral and herbal towards the end with some bitter citrus peel. Medium body with lots of carbonation. Dry mouthfeel.",4.05
In Perpetuity,"First, I was struck by the lack of head on the beer. Then, it was lighter than some of the other beers, but the after-taste had a certain bitterness.",3.4
In Perpetuity,"Traded for this a while ago, as the date on the bottom of the can read 9/8/17 with ""HOLD ON TO"" written above it and sunshine written below it. Loved the name and label of this beer, down to the ""9/20/14"" on the side which was probably the marriage date referenced in the description. This was a typical beer from Tree House and a typical New England IPA in the sense that was cloudy, juicy, and soft but the latter made this so easy to enjoy as the Citra and Nelson were easy to discern as they worked so harmoniously together.",4.19
In Perpetuity,Really hazy yellow color with off-white head. Aroma has pineapple and white grapes. Taste is yeasty with some dough bitterness and citrus rind on the finish. Medium body and carbonation. Yeasty with a leafy hop bitterness. Not as good as expected.,4.25

In Perpetuity,"Might be my favorite of the Treehouse beers I got to try. Had this at a University of Nevada football game. Pours a yellow color with some hop haze going through it, 1/2"" white head. Smell those Citra hops, they're in no small quantity here. But even that amount of Citra can't compete with the imperial dank march of the Nelson hop. And for comparison, I just reviewed Nelson the Greeter from Port, and this blows the doors off that beer. And I'm a guy born in San Diego, the anti-homer. Just crushes you with all kinds of tangerine, papaya and marijuana dankness all over this beer.",4.37
In Perpetuity,Canned on 12/4/18; consumed on 12/6/18 - making this one about 55-60 hours old.,4.74
In Perpetuity,Excellent IPA full of hop juiciness. Citra stand out enhanced with a very slight dryness/tartness likely from the drier Nelson. Subtle malt notes adding some biscuit and thread of caramel. Poured a beautiful merangue like head; stiff with soft peaks with great lacing. Pale soft slightly hazy orange. So remarkably smooth going down. Gentle and foamy on the tongue. A rather unique interesting IPA with its many subtle integrated complexities in an otherwise big Hop juicy brew. Would love try this one again...and again. Outstanding.,4.63

Bomb!,From a 12oz bottle. Jet black color with a half finger of brown head. Boozy malts and cherry smell. Medium feel. Big roasted malt/bitter chocolate/vanilla flavor with a noticeable alcohol/chili pepper burn. A very complex beer that makes an interesting treat.,4.37
Bomb!,"look: no head AT ALL. could have mistaken it for coca-cola. actually pouring it into the bottle, it looks like syrup.",4.3
Bomb!,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Color is a deep reflective jet black, with a slow-rising then descending thin mahogany head that dissipates. Good lacing, but not retention.",4.59
Bomb!,Been a while since I had one of these.,4.31
Bomb!,"Very dark, opaque, seems almost viscous while pouring. Initially no head, then a thin dark tan head forms after pouring, but it doesn't last long, no lacing; Aroma is rich with coffee/chocolate, as expected, with a hint of alcohol; Alcohol is the main ingredient in the flavor, also with coffee/chocolate. The mouthfeel is smooth, not a lot of carbonation, but tangy nevertheless; This is a very expensive beer, a single bottle ($9.99) costing as much as a six-pack of the mass-popular beers. It also is a very interesting beer - much better than the ever-popular Guinness Stout, but does it justify its costliness? I've had stouts or porters that are at least as good, or better, and with a much more reasonable price tag. It leaves a brown residue in the glass.",3.83
Bomb!,"Draught @ Beer Temple, Amsterdam. Black colour. Light brown head with some retention. Aroma's: big roast, umami, chocolate, vegetal/pepper, ground coffee, roast, sweet. Retronasal it’s about the same but different order: sweet, chocolate, peppers, roast, coffee. Flavor is moderate to full sweet, peppery, chocolate. Alcohol feel isn’t as strong as you’d expect with 13%. Medium bodied. Pepper heat is quite mild and not at all as distracting from the flavor as with some beers. Finishes roasty, with moderate bitterness. Really nice, and drinks deceptively easy.",4.06

Aromas and flavor are dark chocolate, vanilla, dark roasted malts, and coffee. Almost no heat from the anchos. The 13% abv is well-hidden although you can tell it's a big beer. Overall a delicious beer.",4.43

Bomb!,"Pours black with a small tan head that vanished quickly. Nice aroma with dark chocolate, cocoa nibs, vanilla, peppers, and coffee. Tastes just like it smells. Same exact score as a result. Medium bodied with modest carbonation. The 14 % abv is hidden very well. A nicely made beer.",4.13
Bomb!,"Bomb pours a thick, motor oil black with very little head that quick recedes leaving no lacing. The smell is cacao nibs over chili peppers with just a hint of coffee and some alcohol. The taste is very complex, full bodied on the palette. Drinks smooth for a 13% ABV beer, with the slightest hint of booze on the finish. It's a very thick cacophony of flavors from the coffee, cacao nibs, to the chili peppers and vanilla, but there is an underlying burnt wood flavor that lingers.",4.51
Bomb!,"Pours seal brown with a paltry skim of khaki foam. Aroma is positively rife with dark chocolate, accented by toffee, chili peppers, coffee, and roasted malt.",3.82
Bomb!,"Not the best imperial stout I've had, but definitely top 3 or 4. I like the heat, but I think it should be dialed down SLIGHTLY to emphasize more of the cocoa nibs and coffee. Absolutely delicious, though and I wish I could rate into the tenths better on this app. Overall, I feel it handsomely earns it's rating. Must have!",4.47

Consecration,"Mostly clear chestnut brown with dark tinting, no head save a thin off-white ring. Lovely and expressive red wine barrel with oak, brett, lacto, dried cherry, currant, and sour plum. Taste really does stand out, was skeptical given the hype and specifically the age of the hype, but the red wine makes this sour, playing with the oak, fruits including the addition of green apple and date, flowers, funk, brett, and lacto really well. Almost has a wine pouched cherry aftertaste with oak. Starts wet and vinous, but slowly and steadily makes its way to a drier and wood tannin laden finish, with green sour and funky textures in between, with all three phases melding into one another, best aspect of the beer. Stands the test of time, well done!",4.45
Consecration,A - Very dark amber; reddish 3/4 inch head that dissipates quickly; active bubbling.,4.45
Consecration,"Received from @bum4ever in a BIF box. Poured from cork and cage bottle into a teku glass. It pours a pretty ruby-orange color. The thin, ecru-colored head dissipated rapidly. On the nose there is red wine, oak, cherry, brown sugar, and Brett yeast. It's highly fragrant. As expected, it's both sweet and sour with tart cherry and currant, red wine grapes, and vinegar, tobacco and oak notes. It finishes surprisingly bitter. The flavors blend very well. It is well-carbonated and drinks below its 10% ABV. Overall, it is a highly flavorful and pleasing ale. I'm very happy to have had the chance to savor it.",4.47
Consecration,"375ml bottle, that was bottled on '022218'.",4.62
Consecration,"Meager dusting of tan foam which is pretty much gone just as the pour settles, in turn no lacing to speak of but one really wasn’t expecting much of either. Light and fully transparent brownish red with wide yellow rims, while the bubbles are about as miniscule as imaginable there are steady streams of them. The sour cherry scents stunted by caramelized brown sugar and molasses notes, touch of coconut flakes, more vinegary than vinous, turns to pie dough and Ovaltine, not as high-toned as expected nor as generally powerful. Medium-bodied, has acidic punch and feels very firm in the mouth. The cherry, currant fruit flavors strong here but so is the oak. Grilled nuts, cocoa, molasses to at times more American oak dill accents. Clean attack, gets funkier towards the finish and retronasally. No astringency, dryness or deep puckering sensations, balanced and approachable. No alcoholic heat either. Even as one notes this, it bears the stamp of a wild ale, albeit mannered. The grip extends the texture a good bit after the flavors have subsided. Not discerning noticeable change as it warms towards room temperature. Suavely arrayed.",4.06
Consecration,"July 27th, 2015 - Legendary and luxurious, I now get to have the Consecration fresh from the tap. Dark and with soda like bubbles on the edge, it gives off a power and luscious smell of sour cherries and candied apples, bright and beautiful. And the flavor gives much the same, with a perfect, perfect sourness and a perfect acidity. The flavor notes feature juicy bordeaux grapes and even a bit of sparkling grape juice. It's far better than it sounds, and absolutely lands the acidity.",4.51
Consecration,Pours a fairly clear dark red color with a thin foamy head that quickly dissipates. Very little to no lacing. Aroma of sour dark fruits and red wine. Tart and smooth taste. Red wine and dark fruits. Very good.,4.22
Consecration,Bottled 1 year ago.,4.46
Consecration,Terrific beer with amazing Brett. Great dank smell with perfect balance between darkness and sour. Great level of carbonation and an absolute pleasure to drink.,4.67
Consecration,375ml bottle,4.43
Consecration,"Pours a ruby-burgundy with a light fog. Head formation is nearly non-existent. Aroma is grapes, currants and oak all layered over a lactic acid sourness. Very straight forward, and focused. Flavor profile is grapes, black currants, oak, toffee and toasted and nutted malts. While it starts with sweet fruit, it ends with a lactic sour twist that lingers on the tongue for a long while after each sip. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a smooth, glossy texture. Overall, a very good sour that mixes fruits well with an underlying and unmistakable sourness.",4.46
Consecration,"Leather, oak, funk, dark fruit, leather, sour stout, leather, acidity, and more leather. Almost as though the a sweaty leather strap soaked in the bottle for a while. It's on the verge of being astringent and bitter and to me the leather overwhelms everything else this beer has to offer. Kind of disappointed in my first RR beer.",3.95
Consecration,"7/19/18...on tap at Monks in Philadelphia. Tulip glass pour. Dark mahogany brown. Low foam. Still. Currants cherries and oak in the nose. Light sour, heavy wood. Mellow and sneaky boozy. Lots of wood. Cabernet all throughout. Fantastic.",4.31

Consecration,"Pretty good. Smells better than it tastes. Aroma is slight with a little bit of sour cherry, says it’s refermented on bottle. Enjoy the smooth bite at top of taster, and had some flavours of the Chardonnay but still had some tendencies of beer instead of drinking a glass of wine. Enjoy!",4.33
Consecration,"The most deceptive 10% ABV beer I've enjoyed to-date. I've had beers that mask higher ABV with massive flavors, i.e. super hopping, bourbon barrel aging, tons of malt, massive fruit additions, etc. but this beer does so with seeming simplicity and grace.",4.53
Consecration,"Pours a dark mahogany color with quickly dissipating white head leaving a tiny ring of bubbly lacing. Nose is dark stone fruit ,currants and funky yeast. Taste follows with a little sweet-tartness and red wine barrel woodiness. May be the best sour I have tried, reminds me of some of the Flemish ales I drank in Belgium.",4.48
Consecration,"From bottle dated 12/16. Great funk and red wine on the nose. Taste is quite complex. Bright in the beginning, funky and barrel in the middle, extremely tart on the finish. This is a good sour but somehow lacks drinkability and overall harmony in flavor for me.",4.21
Consecration,"Russian River Brewing Co. ""Consecration""",4.52
Consecration,"Taster at brewery. Dark amber with small ring of head. Soft, fruity aroma, Brett. Taste is smooth and sweet, mildly tart. Subdued, but complex. This is what sours should be. Simple and clean, approachable.",4.03
Consecration,Let me first say I don't like sours but I'm trying to see if I can develop a taste for them. This review more reflects my particular taste of the style than where this beer fits inside the style. This is a nicely complex beer and I would recommend to anyone who likes sour ales.,3.86
Consecration,"This is as close to perfect as it gets. Unbelievably pungent and pleasant smell courtesy of Napa Valley wine barrels. The taste is tart... No, wait, not tart — sour. It follows the smell well. This tastes natural, real, full. What a great wild ale. In my opinion, there is only one way to surpass this — get a Supplication bottle.",4.9
Consecration,"Just a knock down, drag out good beer. Maybe I am getting cynical over today's craft beer culture or nostalgic over chasing this beer, but hands down it sets the standard for American sour beer. ",4.74
Consecration,"This beer pours a deep purple with a minimal, quickly dissipating head. The aroma is heady and intense, with a strong acetic sour notes, as well as sour cherry jam, blackberry jam, black currant jam, with hints of fig, and graham cracker. The flavor is intense and incredibly complex, with the black currant coming through very strongly, and then a tannic burst that is enormously wine like. There is a chutney tinged, vinegar flavor to the middle, and an almost smoky finish. The mouthfeel is light with bold, bright carbonation. Overall this is an astonishing beer. Probably the best sour I have ever had.",5
Pseudo Sue,"Revised review. I don't stand down from my original, this beer lacks the bitterness and or intensity to score world class. The only beer in this pathetic genre (that would be the NE IPA genre) that scores world class is the bitter, juicy fruit, Alcemist Focal Banger. But this one I had month or so ago? did keep my interest enough to seek it out again Will I go a third time? IDK, $13.50 for 4 is not that bad ...",4.09
Pseudo Sue,"Murky creamsicle orange in color. Poured with a short, soapy white foam with medium low retention. Sharo citrus tangerine and under ripe pineapple with a light dankness. Medium malty aromas. Medium bodied with medium light carbonation. Creamy rich, silky smooth feel followed by boozy warmth that gets a little prickly at the finish. Citrus and pineapple hop flavors with a solid malt backbone. Spicy bitterness slowly expands through the middle. Pine hop and sharp citrus notes on the backend along with fruity flavors and boozy warmth. Finished semi-dryly with light fruity notes and lingering pine hop bitterness. Light fruity notes and malt provide just enough balance with fantastic, fresh, complex hop character. Smooth, creamy feel with pleasant bitterness and just a touch of dankness. This was excellent.",4.4
Pseudo Sue,The hazy orange amber colored beer pours out into a Duvel glass with a 1” layer of frothy white foam that recedes slowly but noticeably to a cap and then eventually to a ring and a thin irregular island of foam on the surface while leaving a web of some legs and rings and large patches of lacing on the sides of the glass. Sipping creates some small patches and irregular legs of lacing.,4.35

Pseudo Sue,16 oz can. Canned on date of 5/09/19. BB date of 9/06/19.,4.18
Pseudo Sue,"It’s a pale ale that tops all. This is my go to beer and tastes terrific with everything. A single citra hop done so well that even uncle Joe would like as well as the most persnickety beer snob. It’s a winner all the way around. Damn I love this one, and I pick it up whenever I go searching for the good stuff.",4.98
Wide Awake It's Morning,"Pours dark brown with ruby highlights at 56 degrees; thick tan foam of mixed bubbles; solid ring, long lasting cap; moderately heavy lacing; thin legs. Strong maple syrup nose; faint whiff of smoke. Flavors of maple, coffee, sweet toffee and caramel candy base; lite roast, char. Full body, slick feel; very little warmth for 9.5%; moderate minus carbonation. Overall the maple has held up well; I could smell the maple wafting from the glass at least a foot plus away; not too adjuncty; the bacon is more a liquid smoke taste, but the dominant taste and aroma is Mrs. Butterworth’s. Funky Buddha excels at flavored pastry stouts, and this beer is one of its best.",4.58
Wide Awake It's Morning,"Pours black with a half inch khaki head that leaves very little lacing. Smells is very maple syrup forward with bacon, coffee and toast coming in the background. Tastes of maple syrup, coffee, molasses, toast, bacon, roasted malts, vanilla, milk chocolate and roasted malts. Full bodied especially for a porter, lightly carbonated, thick and creamy mouth feel, mildly bitter finish.",4.46
Wide Awake It's Morning,"Pours black with two fingers of khaki foam that retains really well. Aroma is heavy maple syrup and coffee with robust notes of roasty, toasty, bready malts and spry vanilla beans just beyond. It smells like a fresh slice of toast, dressed and drenched by maple syrup, while a roasty, steaming cup of coffee sits just aside. Flavor profile is dense and rich, hitting notes of roasty, toasty, nutty, caramely, bready malts, and rich, boisterious notes of coffee, chocolate, vanilla bean and maple syrup. It smell and drinks sweet, but not to a point of being cloying, or sickly. Mouth feel is velvety and creamy, with a thick consistency. Overall, a thick and sugary beer, that while it lands more in the dessert beer category, does present itself exceptionally well as balanced and filling. ",4.5
Wide Awake It's Morning,"Black in color with no light penetration. There’s a fingernail of brown covering nearly all of the top. Light lacing. The aroma is of coffee, maple syrup, and bacon fat. I’m tasting maple syrup, dark chocolate, coffee, and smoky bacon fat. The dark chocolate and coffee really linger after the swallow. The mouth is oily, viscous, and lightly sticky and chewy.",4.29
Wide Awake It's Morning,"A: loads of maple syrup and coffee, chocolate, molasses, and vanilla. Very smooth and balanced",4.18

Wide Awake It's Morning,"Smooth, tasty, and delicious smelling. What else can I say? Basically if a stout and a maple syrup covered pancake joined forces and had a baby together you'd get this beer. Would've liked a hint of bacon, but overall I can't complain.",4.88
Wide Awake It's Morning,"Bottled 04/19/18. Soooo much better than MBCP, but I’m blaming the fact that the base beer wasn’t fresh when I had it two days ago. This is not only “fresher,” but holds up much better in the bottle. This is how I expected the original to taste and smell.",4.69

Wide Awake It's Morning,From a fresh growler:,4.56
Wide Awake It's Morning,"this thing is a beast, even more packed with all of these awesome flavors than the maple bacon is, but without the unifying and mellowing barrel elements of the morning wood. big thanks to my homie for bringing this one over for maple beer night, i had not ever seen it before, but have loved its two sister beers! its as thick and dense looking as it seems like it should be, near black but a high luster and some nice thick foamy tan head. it smells more like coffee than anything else, seemingly higher in the proportionality than in the maple bacon, a little less smoke and greasiness and all too, and still with a high maple sweetness element. there is a lot of nuance here too though like black pepper and fresh tobacco and molasses. its as complex in the flavor too, but we are all sort of stunned at how this isnt super insanely sweet. i mean its still way more sugary than you could reasonably drink a whole bomber of, but this is not over the top at all, despite the maple flavor still being really potent in here. nice almost burnt dark malt complexion to even it out, and all the coffee really helps. i didnt catch a bottle date, but the coffee tastes pretty fresh in here to me, and its intensity cuts some of the weight of the body and the sweetness, i like its contribution a lot. the bacon part of this is a little underwhelming, less obvious in the mix than in the base beer, light campfire smoke is all, this isnt meaty or anything to me. a really intense brew, but as good as any of the wildly flavored stouts these guys do. i dont think it needs the barrel. i enjoyed this edition a lot and it was a great end to our epic maple beer night!",4.31
Wide Awake It's Morning,22 ounce bottle into a snifter. Had 11/4/17.,4.27
Wide Awake It's Morning,So much coffee!! But doesn't taste like burn coffee grounds. Like a well balanced DDH....this is the same with coffee aromas and flavors. On the nose is like waking up at your favorite roastery.....but taste is mellow and warming like your own personal barista caring for this cold brew. FB is a top brewery for a reason,4.56
Wide Awake It's Morning,"This is pretty much Maple Bacon Coffee Porter. It is extremely sweet as the original but it is better balanced by the higher booze. Pours thick and creamy, crazy to think it's a porter.",4.91
Wide Awake It's Morning,22oz bottle poured into a snifter. Not sure the bottle date.,4.52
Wide Awake It's Morning,"Mostly maple with some coffee. Has a metallic flavor to it. Reminds of waffle crisp cereal, you know, it’s not too bad but leaves an after taste that seems really fake maple. Did not enjoy this very much, prefer Hipster Brunch by quite a bit for a beer with these adjuncts. Finished half the bottle and then went on to something else.",3.26
Wide Awake It's Morning,It's been awhile since I experienced MBCP so was really excited to try this one. It does not disappoint.,4.45
Wide Awake It's Morning,"Poured into a 16 oz Snulip glass, not sure when it was bottled and 9.2% ABV. Pours a very attractive slick black with a 2 plus finger dark tan head that leaves thin wisps of lace at near room temperature.",4.37
Wide Awake It's Morning,Looks exceptionally creamy.,4.04
Wide Awake It's Morning,"Pours a rather opaque cola brown that leaves a pencil thin ring of off-white tiny bubbles around the edge of the glass. Smell is dominated by the maple syrup up front with a noticeable coffee middle. The mix of the two do a good job of reminding you of sunday breakfast. The taste follows the smell. The second batch was better than the first because it had a much stronger coffee presence. The first batch was more maple dominated whereas the taste of the second batch is more coffee dominant. I definitely prefer the second batch as it is sweet enough and the coffee does a great job of balancing out the sweetness from the maple syrup. There is also a very subtle smoky finish which is the bacon making itself known. I has sticky silky smooth mouthfeel. Not watery, but not viscous, just right for an imperial porter. Overall this beer is really great and they did a great job in improving it over the initial batch. Initial batch was too sweet and had an acridly bitter finish. 2017 was much more balanced and left a smoky sweet aftertaste. Breakfast in a glass!",4.5

Pugachev Royale,"07/2016 - This is super hot and doesn't hide it, but the nose is chock full of barrel, chocolate, roast, and some anise; the palate kicks ass and is similar to the nose; but the heat lingers and keeps this from being next level for me.",4.23
Pugachev Royale,November 2017 vintage. 18.4% abv. Too hot. ,4.25
Pugachev Royale,"Appearance was weird. Poured like a thin, fizzy, brownish/black soda. Bubbles dissipated after a minute or so. Aroma was a surprising semi-sweet chocolate-covered cherries drenched in maple syrup. Waaay better than the appearance was suggesting. Taste was similar to the aroma, just a little less. Nicely-complex. 18% alcohol, but tasted more like a 10%er. Mouthfeel was thinner than I wanted, but surprisingly not off-putting (with that fizzy pour.) Overall, I was very impressed that the important aspects, aroma and flavor, were so very good in spite of the look/feel. Would drink this again.",4.84
Pugachev Royale,"Dark brown color with a ring of brownish foam. Aroma is boozy with whiskey, rum and brandy notes. Sweet malt, some dark fruits, earthy and woody notes, bitter roasted notes on the finish. Medium to light body with soft carbonation. Complex flavors but a bit light bodied.",4.6
Pugachev Royale,"The slappy, watery black pour forms a fizzy, bubbly mocha head that quickly settles to a thin collar.

Pugachev Royale,"Smells like bourbon and wood, taste of chocolate, chili, lots of booze. The alcohol in this one is really present, maybe let it age for another couple of months so it can soften up a little.",4.33
Pugachev Royale,Excellent chocolate and barrel flavor shines through in this one. The blend of the barrel types coupled with the base stout leads to a very rich and complex stout. I would love to get my hands on another one of these and age it for another year or two.,5

Parabajava,"Parabajava 2016 has, quite sadly, fallen off very badly. Friends and I opened a 2016 side by side with a Parabola 2018... and, surprisingly, the Parabola was the superior of the two. The Parabajava had very little coffee left to brag of, unfortunately - mostly just a lingering acidic taste with a strange umami and vegetal taste. I was tremendously disappointed, after having traded for this bottle.",3.99
Parabajava,**,4.7
Parabajava,"this review comes with an asterisk, which is that i must have had a somewhat off experience with this one, in that there is no way the whole world loves this so much and i found it unremarkable. i have wanted to try this for a long long time and was so stoked to finally get the chance, but i suspect a distributor or an account or even the brewery held on to this keg for way too long, knowing they had something special here and wanting to save it for just the right moment. well, to me it tastes like that moment had long passed by the time this one was flowing, the coffee tastes and smells stale, and it has seemingly broken down some of the body that makes this base beer so monumental. what i can appreciate is what its supposed to be, a rich espresso layer over one of the most flavorful and interesting stouts to ever exist, an unnecessary but fancy layer, a little green peppery now, and a little acidic and thinning, but probably absurdly appealing in its prime. the alcohol is somehow really well hidden, maybe one benefit of its apparent age, cant believe its as strong as it is. some nice dark chocolate and char to this, still plenty of barrel on it too, faint vanilla and tobacco as well, lots happening but wonderful integration at the same time. i enjoyed this still a lot, impossible not to, but in this instance certainly not one of the best beers in the world. i know what it can be though, and i cant wait to try it under more idea conditions... until next time!",4.01

Parabajava,"Dark brown, just a tad darker than milk chocolate. Forms a nice ring of cream colored head around the glass with some lace spots. Aroma of balanced malt, fruit, wood and coffee. To be fair, this beer is over a year old and the coffee has most likely fallen off some. Very nice wood and bourbon character. Sweet, boozy and vanilla tones. Medium to full body but slightly low carbonation and watery, thin finish.  Still very good overall thanks to wood and bourbon. I would recommend drinking fresh however as the coffee flavor was fairly subdued.",4.08
Parabajava,"Served in a 8oz glass, very mild coffee smell. Prunish choco w a bit of molasses. Not boozy at all. More prunes or dates as it warms up. Easy sipper, I like it. very mild for a 15%, this could sneak up on you very easily.",4.27

Samuel Adams Utopias,"I know it looks foolish to do all 5s. But this ""beer"" is off the charts. The taste is more like a (non-carbonated) sherry-cognac with a maple overtone. At 28% alcohol, these brews last for a very long time. My collection goes back 10 years. The 2009, opened for a decade, still tastes great. I just have tiny sips, so I can extend the experience over the years.",5
Samuel Adams Utopias,Shared 2017 canister. ,4.49
Samuel Adams Utopias,"8000th review! 8 ounce pour from a 24 ounce bottle; 2017 vintage bottling. Bottle #14819. Pours still, slightly hazy ruby reddish/orange/copper color. No head or lacing, but tons of alcohol legs on the glass. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big raisin, plum, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, berries, red grape, port, sherry, rum, brandy, cognac, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, honey, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, biscuit, roasted nuts, and brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of licorice, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, oak char, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, peppercorn, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Increasing booze in the aromas, but not too overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready/light roasted malts, fruity yeast, and multiple barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge raisin, plum, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, berries, red grape, port, sherry, rum, brandy, cognac, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, honey, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, biscuit, roasted nuts, and brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of licorice, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, oak char, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, peppercorn, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Taste of huge raisin, plum, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, berries, red grape, port, sherry, rum, brandy, cognac, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, honey, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, biscuit, roasted nuts, and brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of licorice, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, oak char, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, peppercorn, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Light oak char bitterness, and barrel tannin/alcohol spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of dark fruits, cherry, apricot, berries, red grape, port, sherry, rum, brandy, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, honey, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, biscuit, roasted nuts, brown bread/crust, licorice, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, oak char, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, peppercorn, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malts, fruity yeast, and multiple barrel flavors; with a great malt/oak spiciness balance, and no cloying sweetness after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering barrel tannin and spicy alcohol. Fairly full body; with a smooth, creamy/slick, and lightly syrupy/tannic mouthfeel that is fantastic. Light-moderate increasing warmth of 28%, some lingering barrel booze after the finish; but not overwhelming. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged strong ale! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malts, fruity yeast, and multiple barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on slowly for the enormous ABV. As expected this is like a cross between beer and all above mentioned spirits. Mind blowing amounts of complexity; and everything is perfectly integrated with all the different barrels. A highly amazing offering, and world class beer for what it was. A truly unique experience.",4.38
Samuel Adams Utopias,"The odd beer that smells better than it tastes. No issue as both are excellent. Medium dark color, nice head. Don't overdo this one, drinks more like a liquor than a beer.",4.7
Samuel Adams Utopias,"Pours a clear chestnut color, no carbonation. One of the most amazing aromas I have ever had the privledge of enjoying. Tons of burnt sugar, dark fruits, raisins, molasses, dark brown sugar, nutty. I found myself smelling the small snifter well after the liquid was drank. It didn’t taste nearly as good as it smelled, which was fine. A little goes a long way with this beverage. It is delicious, but I would never buy a bottle. But, if a bar is pouring it, I am all in. ",4.5
Samuel Adams Utopias,"Bottle: Poured a clear dark copper color ale. Aroma of oak and liquor with some warming alcohol notes also perceptible. Taste is a mix of caramelized notes with some barrel notes, some oak and light residual sugar notes. The alcohol can be detected but this is in the range that I actually enjoy since it is not burning too much. Quite the experience and very enjoyable overall.",4.4
Samuel Adams Utopias,"Drinks like a liquor, notes of whiskey, raisin, nutty, complex has heck. It’s a different flavor each sip with how the different flavors interact. Happy new year!",4.46

Samuel Adams Utopias,A buddy of mine picked one up about 2 weeks after a bottle shop told me that they had it but couldn't sell it to me yet. So I saved $200 and still got to try it. It tasted more like beer than I was expecting and I have found myself craving it ever since! Almost enough to wish that I had bought the bottle. Almost.,5
Samuel Adams Utopias,So as you have probably heard this is almost more of a port or sherry than a beer. One of the things unique to the 2017 version is that parts of the blend were aged in Muscat barrels and Aquavit barrels.,4.5
Samuel Adams Utopias,"I never thought I would get to try this beer. But one fine day a certain beer expert whose initials are SH shared some with me. And man, it is strange stuff for beer. More like a nice brandy. Smooth smooth but little carbonation, nice fruity aroma and deep dark taste is what I recall. I may never have it again, but it was good to have then. Thanks Stan, you da Man!",4.51
Samuel Adams Utopias,"2017 vintage, gifted to me by @mattflippin. An clear amber-brown color. Complex nose with vanilla, cherries, caramel, toffee, whiskey, and faint bready malt. On entry I tasted the bready Munich malt and this wsa quickly accompanied by stone fruit, vanilla, oak, whiskey, and caramel. Ever so slightly tart which melded perfectly with the overall taste. Faint floral ",4.49
Samuel Adams Utopias,"Bought this for a friend's 40th birthday party and shared with anyone that knew what Utopias was (about 4 others). As other BAs have said, it's difficult to rate this and/or describe it as it is so far removed from any beer I have ever tried. Poured into a 2 oz shot glass, it is medium brown and leggy like a brandy. Smells like waffles with maple syrup (consensus of everyone in the room, whether drinking this or not) and the taste was like like a hybrid of an Eisbock and a port wine. Warmed all the way down, again more like a brandy or cognac. At 28% alcohol, no carbonation and none expected. Was a unique treat that I'm glad I got to try.",4.5
Samuel Adams Utopias,"Got completely lucky that I was even able to try Utopias, just right place at the right time. Now, trying it would I call it beer? I guess technically. It is certainly memorable because there is nothing like it out there. Unbelievably smooth and rich, sort of like a cognac. So much flavor on the palate it is a lot to take in, and thus the fun is finding a new flavor each sip. Love beers that push the edge of what is out there!",4.75
Samuel Adams Utopias,"Unfortunately this beer is all hype and not much substance, it lacked flavor tasting like an old beer slightly flat, had a bit of a malty taste to it but overall just didn't wow me. I would rather just drink Boston Ale since it just reminded me of an old version of that Beer.",1.75
Samuel Adams Utopias,"More of a cognac than a beer. Pours completely flat, no head. Very harsh on the nose, a little like acetone I'm not really digging the smell. The tongue is a little better, nutty and molasses, leathery, sweet.",3.76
Samuel Adams Utopias,"Hard to rate this one. When I first got it, wet opened it soon after and drank some.... and I was a tad disappointed. I knew not to expect a typical beer, and it does drink almost more like a congac, but that wasn't what bothered me. And it was almost three years ago, so it's hard to say now, but I think the alcohol taste overpowered any of the tastes I would later enjoy.",4.88
Samuel Adams Utopias,"Served room temperature, Utopias is clear, tiger-eye brown. The appearance is pretty close to bourbon, with clear legs and no carbonation.",4.21
Samuel Adams Utopias,"While not quite a beer, utopias is perfection in a glas. Pours a deep ruby tinged deep brown, still beer, HUGE alcohol legs. Nose is boozy toffee, maple, caramel.Taste is insanity. The booze, toffee, and maple run consistent, but every taste brings something different. Figs, cherries, apple skins, prunes are among the ever evolving flavors. The beer is thick and heavy.",5
Samuel Adams Utopias,"So different from almost any other beer. So intense and so complex. Pitch black and no head whatsoever. Molasses, raisin, and brandy dominate the nose and palate, with slight background tones of hazelnut and spice. Mouthfeel is full, and the finish gives a little heat and kick. The best part about it is that the taste lingers on your tongue and air passages for a couple minutes after each sip ... reminiscent of a good 25 year scotch. One of a kind, must try!",4.59

Black Tuesday - Reserve,"2015 bottle poured at a share last night. Beer pours dark brown in color. Not completely opaque. Small mocha head forms and dissipates quickly, probably running from the 20.5% abv (haha). Aromas of caramel, fudge, oak and booze fill my nose. Set the glass on the table a few feet away and I could still smell it. Taste is all of the above....lots of fudge, chocolate, caramel, vanilla, oakiness and some definite booze. For 20.5%, I expected some heat, even with a 3 yr old beer. Drinks thicker than it looks. Coated the mouth with vanilla, caramel and booze. Overall, even with the hints of booziness there, this is still relatively smooth. Excellent beer.",4.53

Black Tuesday - Reserve,"Popped this bottle at an epic Omaha, Nebraska bottle share. Poured into a teku. I felt this was a little over hyped. Drinkability was nice for a 21%er... Better than Black Tuesday. Mouthfeel was lacking a bit. Not worth going out of your way for imo.",4.18
Black Tuesday - Reserve,Black in color. No head.,4.53
Black Tuesday - Reserve,"One of the best Black Tuesday bottles I have ever had. Drank this along side a 2009 Black Tuesday and, while the '09 was a clear winner, the Reserve held it's own very well. Excellent barrel character and flavor with absolutely no heat. Everything you would want out of this beer after reading the description",4.88
Black Tuesday - Reserve,"I've only had this once. Liked it more than regular BT, but still had the typical Bruery sweetness and heat. Definitely more complex and interesting that regular though, and overall a tasty beer that's perfect for a big share.",4.27
Black Tuesday - Reserve,"Pours black. Smells of Charred oak, vanilla, and a caramel. Tastes amazingly of the bourbon barrels and caramel. very viscous. This is a Barrel aged stout at its finest.",5
Black Tuesday - Reserve,Pours a thick black color with minimal head. Smells of dark chocolate and bourbon. Incredibly smooth taste with chocolate and vanilla and smooth bourbon. Nice thick mouth feel. Unbelievable beer.,4.85
Black Tuesday - Reserve,"Big mouthfeel, huge bourbon, chocolate and caramel. Slight alcohol bite but overall unbelievably smooth for 20%. Can't wait to revisit this one in a year. My favorite Bruery stout yet and one of my favorites of all time.",5
Black Tuesday - Reserve,From 750 mL bottle to snifter,4.86
Black Tuesday - Reserve,"Jet black pour with a 3/4"" tan head on the top of it, looks gorgeous like a model. So much chocolate smells on this one, vanilla, bourbon. ",4.93
Black Tuesday - Reserve,"On tap at the Bruery. Poured into a Bruery tulip. They hype is real on this one. Pours pitch black. The smell is great, vanilla, bourbon, charred wood, that Bruery sweetness. The taste mimics the smell. The feel is smooth viscous and my word does it ever hide that 20% alcohol. One of the best out there.",5
Black Tuesday - Reserve,A friend in Hoarders shared this with us. This was super smooth for the ABV. I have had the regular version of this also. I found this just as good if not better.,4.5
Black Tuesday - Reserve,This beer is awesome! Smoother than regular Black Tuesday. Does not taste like 20% whatsoever. The blend is what sets this beer apart though. Rich thick stoutiness with excellent barrel aged flavors. Thanks Bruery!,5
Black Tuesday - Reserve,This beer was without a doubt one of the best beers the Bruery ever put out.,5
Black Tuesday - Reserve,"Tried this along side 2015 BC Rare. This is quite similar to the regular version of Black Tuesday, but in my opinion, this beer is extremely hot right now. I would recommend letting it sit for at least a year or two before trying.",4.77
Black Tuesday - Reserve,look: dark!!!,4.85
Black Tuesday - Reserve,Black Tuesday is an intense stout with massive chocolate and caramel notes. Reserve's barrel character manages to bring balance to this monster of an ale.,4.87
Black Tuesday - Reserve,"Really incredible beer. Starts with all the characteristics of regular Black Tuesday, but rounds off whatever rough edges there might be in the original. Where the original is a bit too sweet, Reserve pulls back just enough and allows the barrel to shine. Mouthfeel is perfect and chewy. Taste is outstanding and the bourbon/chocolate/vanilla/fudge/barrel characteristics linger in a satisfying way that is reminiscent of a good bourbon more than a good beer.",4.86
Framboos,"Priciest beer I've bought to date -- ~$50 in Belgium. Sat on this for about a year awaiting the right occasion, and my friend's bachelor party seemed like a great time to bring it out. Simply put, this is a wonderful lambic that is overflowing with raspberry character. The clean funky-tartness of the base lambic complements the intense raspberry nicely and the drinkability is top-notch, as per usual with 3 Fonteinen. Reminded me a lot of Allagash's Coolship Red, which is a more reasonably priced and (relatively) easily available alternative. ",4.5
Framboos,"I drank 3 Fonteinen Framboos a raspberry Lambic imported from Belgium, ABV 5.30%, in my backyard. It was truly delicious as well as thirst quenching (hot here), and my wife and my daughter who tasted it as well agrees with me. Lambic connoisseurs will love it and so will everyone else. This might be the best Lambic I've ever had.",4.96

Framboos,5/29/19,4.69
Framboos,"This pours a light pink (think the color of a rose wine) with a light pink head. The smell is tart raspberries with a slight barnyard funk. Overall, the nose matches the taste as this is sharp and tart with a slight amount of raspberry sweetness to balance it all out. Additionally, there is a slight barnyard funk that you'd expect in a lambic. The mouthfeel is clean and refreshing. Overall, a great example of the style.",4.53
Framboos,Huge thank to BeerThursdays for this,4.68
Framboos,Foggy burnt red with a soft burnt white collar.,4.27
Framboos,"Hazy reddish, rust color with a bit of pinkish foam. Aroma has fresh raspberry with pits, raspberry preserve juice and some lambic funk. Taste is sour, dry, fruity, astringent with berry pit bitterness on the finish. Medium minus body with medium carbonation. Really fruit forward, tart, easy drinking.",4.6
Framboos,"different label than the one pictured here, the double label, looks nice, lighter pink than expected and lighter in color than hommage, 2018 vintage. short head, nice clarity, and a ton of fruit in the nose. i think the cherry in the hommage adds more than it immediately gets credit for, as this seems in some ways one dimensional, not a critique necessarily, as its really pure and ripe and beautiful raspberry, but there is less complexity there. the fermentation profile is awesome, a little younger lambic base, but its perfect with the fruit, its cool to still be able to taste and appreciate the grain in this, lots of oak, rose wine and flowers, lemons and minerals, i think it tastes slightly less dramatic than it smells. a little sulfur and then the fruit, red wine, and lots of oak, mature but cleaner than some of their others i have had, maybe because its so new, but its tidy and fast to finish, even with all the raspberries. their base lambic always stands out to me as one of the best, and the fruit really works well here. id like to try this a little more bottle aged, but i sure did enjoy this one. nice with chocolate and cakey dessert...",4.31
Framboos,2017/18 bottle.,4.8
Framboos,"2014 bottle, pours near still, no head, some tiny bubbling. Aroma is raspberry, funk. Taste:. Heavy on the raspberry, funky, lactic sourness, yogurt. Lighter body, faintest hint of carbonation. And I still loved it.",4.62
Framboos,Bottle from 3 Fonteinen tasting room. Amazing amazing beer. Mild sweetness from the raspberries with and intense acidic quality to the beer. The barnyard wet leather comes through at the end. Well worth seeking out.,4.77
Framboos,"2014 bottle poured into a bulb. Beautiful color...deep ruby red. Smells of funky raspberry jam. Taste isn’t as expected as I was expecting more fruit. There’s fruit there just not as jammy as I had hoped. Still outstanding though. Feel is nice. What you’d expect for this style. Overall, excellent beer. So happy I got to try. Thanks Ray for sharing.",4.46
Framboos,"A: Pour’s a merlot, ruby rose color with some transparency. The head is minimal with absent retention, and lacing",4.45
Framboos,"750ml bottle dated 06/2014. This wasn't totally flat, there was a tiny bot of fizz. Dark pink color. Aroma was great, lots of raspberry and lambic. The flavor was alright, it was slightly sour, raspberries but honestly I was expecting to be blown away and I wasn't. This was a good framboise but I preferred Hommage.",3.96
Framboos,"Poured at pretty close to fridge temp. Look is ruby red with slight transparency. Nose is deep and complex. Raspberries, sweet candy. Taste is WOW. So fruit forward. Almost like straight squeezed juice. No alcohol presence. Dry and sticky, with tart raspberries. Good level of sourness. Overall, this was amazing.",4.42
Framboos,"Thanks to james for bringing this to March Madness. Twas the first and only time I've ever had it. I always dig the appearance on beers with so much fruit that they turn this mixture of purple, pink and red. Sweet. Head can't be retained so don't try to explain it. Aroma of sourness and what is that, raspberry & strawberry? ",4
Framboos,2014 belgian bottle drank out of my SP stem on 7/27/17,4.39
Framboos,"2014 vintage, poured into a taster. Tons of raspberries, some oak, a nice bit of funk. Jammy mouthfeel that sets it apart from other raspberry lambics.",4.68
Framboos,"Cloudy, crimson pour. Wonderful fruit nose. Very tart and vinegary on the palate with a fantastic fruit presence. Lightly carbonated and dry on the finish.",4.5
Framboos,"2014 vintage. Its well known that this vintage is practically flat and that was a problem for me. This is still an excellent beer. It has a dry raspberry flavor, mostly skin and seed, red wine, hay, bandaid, lemon, funk, and vinegar with a light mouth feel and dry finish. The aroma and flavors are strong and well balanced, but this leans toward the dry, musty, complex flavors rather than blasting you with raspberries. That's a good thing by the way. The raspberries don't get lost at all. Glad I was able to try this, but for the price I don't see myself reaching for this again.",4.19
Framboos,"Had the 2014 Framboos the other night. Poured with light carbonation. Nice red color, the smell is fantastic, straight raspberry coming through on the nose. Very nice taste and smooth. Top pour was super bright red, bottom pour was more hazy. Great beer, nice to finally try it. Probably the best raspberry sour I've ever had.",4.73
Framboos,"Bottle: Poured a hazy red color Lambic with a medium foamy head with light retention and lacing. Aroma of funky barnyard notes with some tart raspberry notes. Taste is a mix of funky barnyard notes with some tart raspberry notes, light vinegary notes are also perceptible with some acidity. Body si full with limited filtration and good carbonation. Really enjoyable but maybe not as much balance as I was expecting from this brewery.",4.14
Framboos,"2014 Vintage. Poured from a 750mL bottle into a 3F ""3"" script tumbler glass. Acquired in a trade. ",4.56
Framboos,2014 Vintage.,4.65
Hommage,Lived up to my high expectations. A bright pink color in the glass with a modest white head. Aromas and taste lined up with bright raspberry and cherry bathed in complex funk. There was a mineral quality to the beer that complimented the flavors.,4.43
Hommage,"Waited to tick this one for years. Delicious fruit-foward lambic. Not nearly as dry as I was expecting based on other 3f products. Pours a pinkish red with ample, stubborn head for the style. Smells of funk, leading you to expect dryness in taste. Tart but sweet fruit up front. All the berries. Funk to finish but sweetness still prevails. Would gladly drink again; although expected drier.",4.2
Hommage,Look – The cork popped nicely on this. Pours a dirty raspberry color with a nice thick pinkish red head and lots of lacing.,3.55
Hommage,4/21/19,4.46
Hommage,"A lot of fresh raspberries, small amount of tart cherries keeps the tartness to manageable levels. A classic blend of lambics and fruit from one of the world's most revered brewers. A must-have!",4.02
Hommage,"The beer pours ruby red with a medium pink head that recedes quickly. It has medium carbonation. The beer smells of raspberries, cherries, funk, and cheese. It tastes tart, with raspberries, cherries, cheese, funk, and minerals. Fuller body than most lambic, and on the sweet side. A great fruited Lambic here.",4.52
Hommage,An amazingly brewed raspberry red lambic with smells of musty raspberries and cherries and brett. Tastes of raspberry sweetness hit the palate first followed by sour cherries and brett with subtle oakiness. This particular beer was aged Mar. 22 2018 and drinking it exactly 1 year later on Mar. 22 2019. Very very good but not giving a 5 only because I find Cantillon to be slightly better.,4.85
Hommage,Love this blend. The cherry adds just enough tartness to balance out the sweet raspberries.,4.74
Hommage,Tasted from bottle. Pours a nice dark ruby red with faint pink head. Lots of berries on the aroma. Very crushable. Huge raspberries on the flavor. You do get just a hint of sour cherries. Nice light and effervescent on the mouthfeel. Delicious.,4.93
Hommage,L: Rich dark red color.,4.51
Hommage,"Pink berry juice pour with quick white cap; no retention or lace; no real clarity, just verging on opaque. Nose is sour berries, funky barnyard straw and wt horse blanket. Sour raspberries, funky hay up front; semi sweet base middle; dry tart finish. Light body with medium light carbonation; puckering with some acidity. Complex mix of fruit notes that blend well with a horsey nose; the fruit is vibrant and the tart raspberries shine.",4.7
Hommage,Bright reddish-copper with a thick fuzzy white collar of bubbles.,4.06
Hommage,"This is a great Lambic, one of the best I've ever had. It lives up to the hype.",4.56
Hommage,"This beers greatest strength is also its greatest weakness: the bursting ripe fruit. It is great in the smell with a bouquet of raspberry, apple, lime, strawberry and peach. The taste it drive the other flavors of hay, mushroom, soil, and wood, but the weakness come in how it continues to dominate into the aftertaste where it promptly turn to vinegar, which is a shame because 3 fonteinen almost never does this. However, you can taste that this was well crafted with a love of good beer, and it shows everywhere else.",4.25
Hommage,"Color and complexity on the nose are great, however to Rustic and earthy and not enough part lactic acid for me to really enjoy it. Honestly not worth the hype in my opinion",3.64
Hommage,"Pours a deep, dark red coloration with tiny, fizzy, quickly receding head. Intoxicating aroma dominated by ripe raspberries and sour cherries, with a hint of earthy funk. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by ripe raspberry with a hint of sour cherries and a slight, zesty citrus note in there as well. Some barnyard funk with a certain, earthy, musty, woody quality. Starts out with fruity sweetness that turns quite sour and funky in the aftertaste. With an exceptional balance of fruitiness, sweetness ans sourness, this is proof once again that Drie Fountainen is easily a league above Cantillon.",4.64

Hommage,"Poured from bottle at the Brussels Beer Fest. Pours a pinkish color. Nose is sour, funk, and citrus. Taste is sweet, and sour cherries. Somewhat mouth puckering, with lemon. A bit funky for sure. Mouthfeel is medium and sticky. Overall, a really nice beer.",4.21
Hommage,750ml cork and cage bottle poured into a snifter,4.42
Hommage,2015 Vintage. Excellent fruit combo. Right amount of acidity and funk combined with fruit. Really enjoyed this. Didn't seek it for a long time and I don't know why. This up there with a lot of Cantillon fruited stuff and actually might prefer it over some vintages of St. Lam.,4.58
Hommage,"2015 vintage, poured into a taster. Raspberry and slightly detectable cherry, balanced nicely with the funk and oak. Slight lean to Framboos '14 on a side-by-side.",4.52

Hommage,"Top flight lambic as you'd expect from DF. Well balance, perfect fruit tones, and real nice nose. A bit more head and mouth feel wouldn't hurt but definately not a weakness. Wouldn't mind a little more funk either, but still top flight.",4.48

Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,"A disproportionately gargantuan blast of tangerines is followed up by notes of mango, raw papaya, grass jelly, and even more sweet citrus. Just a disclaimer, I'm having a really hard time writing this review as I drink because this drinks absurdly smooth and easy. There's a hint of biscuit-y malt toward the back which neatly keeps all the aromas from running amok.",4.5
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,2 month old can. An extra from a recent trade. Way passed its prime. Malty mess. Very surprised how fast these fade away. I've had some really great NEIPAs with 3 months on them and never taste this off... Damn shame.,3.46
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,"After being politely asked to vacate my Lyft for defecating in my freshly ironed Skidz, I'm dumped curbside in front of the gleaming ray of light known as Other Half Brewing. Waddling in like an elderly penguin entering a Best Western, I catch the attention of a beautiful bartender and order a beer. I take a sip and I’m instantly transported to Gordon Blevins' basement circa 1999. With Crazy Town’s smash hit “Butterfly” blastin' and ol' Blevy by my side, I couldn’t think of a happier time… until now. My Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream has finally come true. Unlike my shorts, this beer is super clean, light bodied and crisp, with no lingering flavors. It's super drinkable—you keep going back for more. Juicy, pithy tropical fruit on the back and peach supporting it nicely in the crack. A very nice DDH DIPA with a bitter bite in the finish. Just another great IPA from a great brewery.",4.62
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,Bottom of can: 2/19/19,4.51
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,"Pours dark yellow. Smells of hops like a typical New England IPA. Solid beer, but reminds me a lot of some of the other IPAs I've already had. I think the addition of lupulin powder adds nuance to the typical hop profile.",4.36

Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,"these lupulin powder beers are absurd! this is really special beer, easily my favorite of the rash of recent ipa types i have had from other half, and all of them have been great, but this is just on its own level! when i pop the can, it seriously fills the room with mosaic goodness, no mistaking the hop, the intensity is insane, and its everywhere, how the can even contained it seems weird to me, like this had to be ready to jump out of there, its filling the house! not as hazy as the rest of them have been lately, with a nice thick white head on it, a new foam mustache every time i take a pull. the absolute essence of mosaic on display here, through and through, maybe the best expression i have ever known of it, certainly in a long time it is, basic grain profile, enough sweetness to carry in the middle, less so in the finish, the lupulin powder aspect i think cranks the intensity to 11, especially in the nose. the flavor is pineapple, white tea, clementine, and orange tic tac candy, with some lemongrass and honey notes too, i almost feel guilty drinking it, like it is so nice it deserves to be left in one piece or something. so much mosaic, even a little bitterness to help it finish which so few of these have. not heavy to drink at all, even at temperature. id love to try the same recipe with other hops and their respective lupulin powders, this really was a game changer for me. glad i have one more can in the fridge!!!",4.57
Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,"Mosaic shines incredibly well all over the ale, namely the aromas; the hops work well with lactose on the palate, plus some peach supporting it nicely in back; thick mouthfeel, with juicy, peach qualities lingering.",4.5

Listen - that's all part of the secret Italian ingredient - keep it cool, confident, arrogant and extravagant. Forza Italia."" Brewed in the style of an American Imperial Stout, brewed with natural flavor and aged in Bourbon Barrels. Available in 22 oz. bottles and on limited annual release draft.",4.14
Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Poured a thick black almost like oil with very little brown head, Smell is maple, bourbon, coffee, and chocolate with some booze. The flavor is more of the same with a smooth feel. An amazing beer!",4.7
Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Absolutely excellent beer. Opened a 2014 vintage that had been properly cellared since purchase. Poured nice and dark. Lighter aroma of oak and bourbon. Flavors had dropped a slight bit, but came together perfectly. Nothing overly prominent, just a delicious mixture of all the flavors. Could drink this all day",4.66
Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Evil Twin is a perennial goat for me when it comes to breweries (overpriced, under good), but this is an unqualified winner. Great barrel character. Seek out.",4.5
Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"This is one of my fav style's of beer and I was very much looking forward to this one after stumbling upon a bottle while looking for something else. I had heard the hype and was excited to try it. I'm not going to say it disappointed me but it certainly did not live up to the hype. Again , not a bad brew but not worth the price point and not up to the talk. Nice aroma and coffee/chocolate are there but kinda weak IMO. Being in Jersey maybe I'm spoiled by Kane's Porters/Stouts - which are clearly superior - but this one didn't do it for me.",4.33
Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Bomber. Pours black with thin tan head, fades to a ring that lasts. Incredible aroma, vanilla and bourbon and coffee. Bourbon vanilla chocolate shake taste, with some more bourbon. Flavors blend together seamlessly. While boozy, this brew has a ton of flavor, bittersweet chocolate and vanilla finishes it off. Medium slick feel. This one lives up to the hype, well done.",4.6
Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"This was a fantastic beer. Best enjoyed as a dessert beer after a fine dinner. The hazelnut flavor rings through and walks hand-in-hand with the coffee flavors. Light hints of chocolate in the after taste remind me of nutella. The feel is perfect, it is smooth like a creamy cappuccino. This beer is perfect for rapping up a fine evening.",4.79
Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"This is another super rich imperial stout. Incredibly thick, black brew with minimal head/carbonation. Smells of bourbon and the wood flavor really comes through more than most RIS. It has this strong coating and chewiness as well. Absolutely spectacular among stiff competition.",5
Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Tons of dark chocolate and bourbon in the nose. Also a little vanilla, leather, and faint coffee. The taste starts off with more of the big chewy chocolate, accompanied by some nice bourbon heat. Unfortunately around mid-palate, there is a noticeable drop-off in the flavor profile. Subtle notes of vanilla and oak can be found, but the overall complexity (or lack thereof) keeps this just outside elite status in my opinion. Although the heavy fudgy chocolate on the front end gives a nice impression of viscous creaminess, it seems to finish a bit thin for the style. I will say I was quite impressed by the abundance of bourbon character, without feeling boozy or overwhelming. Overall, it's very very good, and I'd happily drink another.",4.33
Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Looks like a typical imperial stout. Smell and flavor are both really heavy on the bourbon, hiding most of the biscotti flavor of the original. Definitely a bit thin. All in all a nice barrel flavor but much like the non-BB version I just don't seem to like this beer nearly as much as others.",3.8
Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Met expectations almost exactly. Lovely flavors, but a touch artificially sweet. Not much character to it, but it goes deep on that chocolate cake flavor, so it winds up being rather enjoyable. Worth buying if you see it, not really worth seeking out.",4.29
Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"This was a significant improvement on the base beer. Like the base, it tastes of licorice, raisins, and almonds. Some chocolate comes through as well. Its very rich on the nose and flavor. The base tastes course and artificial to me, but the bourbon barrel helps to smooth that out. I get a little vanilla from the barrel and I really like how the bourbon integrates with the base beer. The bourbon flavor is pleasant without excess booziness. The mouth feel is on the lighter side of medium and there is a little chalkiness that detracts from the feel. Overall, its a very good beer with a few flaws.",4.18
Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,Pours dark with a nice head. Chocolate aroma. Nice chocolate start to a nice light licorice middle to a bourbon finish. Exceptional stout. One of my favorite stout breweries.,4.65
Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"22oz bomber poured into two pint glasses. Pours a viscous motor-oil black forming a thin sliver of dense head dark mocha head. The head is finely dotted with thin bubbles, recedes exceedingly slowly, and has excellent retention, leaving moderate lacing. The nose on this beer is bourbon through and through. Chocolate notes are unmistakeable, along with a sweet-biscuit - almost cookie - element that is decidedly unique. The palate follows the nose, opening with boozy bourbon, milk and dark chocolate, and an almost chocolate-chip-cookie-like flavor. Mouthfeel is chewy and creamy - not quite on par with the best-of-the-best BB Imp Stouts, but solid. If you had told me that this beer was a slightly more subtle and bourbon barrel aged part of the Southern Tier Blackwater series, I'd hardly be surprised - there's the faintest hint of artificial in the flavoring here: not enough to ruin what is otherwise a very good beer, but enough to be noticed. Ultimately, the various elements of this beer come together to make a very well done Imp Stout. Top of its class? No. Overpriced and overhyped? Without a doubt. But another solid brew from Evil Twin? Most definitely.",4.33
Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"This is hands down three or four times better than non barrel aged imperial biscotti break. The bourbon adds a nice complexity that also dulls what I would call the ""fake"" flavors of regular biscotti break.",4.5
Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"This beer looks appropriately awesome, pouring blacker than any beer ought to and with a gorgeous, chocolate brown head. As for taste and texture, there's nothing wrong with it; it certainly checks off all the boxes of what a BBA stout ought to be, so I can't call it a disappointment by any measure. That said, when you charge $25 a bottle, I expect a little something extra to set itself apart, and I can't say this fits that bill. If this were, say, $16 a bottle, I'd highly recommend it. As it stands, I'd still recommend it, but it's far from a must-have.",4.22

Abrasive Ale,"As many (most?) have noted, the pine is this thing’s piece de resistance. I think that in my hazy craze I’d forgotten how great a good old-fashioned double IPA could be. Ridiculously tasty.",4.36

Abrasive Ale,Poured from a 16 ounce can into a snifter.,4.68
Abrasive Ale,Can poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewing CO pint glass,4.32
Abrasive Ale,"Barely hazy golden beer with a sticky head. The aroma is yeasty, malty, fruity and piney. The taste is sweet, grassy, citrusy and super bitter. Nice medium mouthfeel with great carbonation. Glad to have finally tried this and a welcome break from the many NEIPAs I’ve been drinking.",4.39
Abrasive Ale,Lots of pine in this awesome DIPA. It pours dark amber with a red-like hue. The aroma and flavor profile are dominated by pine and grassy notes. The malt base is awesome and balances the intense bitterness very nicely. Full bodied. ,4.49
Abrasive Ale,Body is just faintly sandy of haze with a large but light off-white foam that dies much quicker than you think to a thin ring leaving some sporadic fuzzy lace.,4.12
Abrasive Ale,Poured from 16oz can into glass. Stamped 'CANNED ON DATE' of '10/18/17 08:33'.,4.59
Abrasive Ale,"Tasted from can. Pours a slight hazy orange with white head. Aroma is tropical and citrus fruits with some floral notes. Taste is pretty in your face bitter. Flavors of orange, resin, pine, grapefruit, passion fruit, floral notes. Huge bitter IPA. Very well done.",4.77
Abrasive Ale,I'm sharing a can of this with my bro-in-law over the 4th Holiday. It poured a hazy orangish with no head and no lace. The scent had hints of sweetness and citrus spice. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink for a dipa. The mouthfeel was fuller in body with good carbonation. Overall it was a solid beer.,3.95
Abrasive Ale,"Rcvd in trade. Two cans. This was poured into a pint glass and a snifter. There was barely any difference between the two glasses. The appearance was a nice looking hazy orange to brown color with a decent one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. Once the head died down, the lacing wove around the glass in a nice speckled sort of fashion. The smell had a nice blend of sweet citrus to sweet sharp freshly cut pine and it came through in a strong aromatic way allowing a decent sweet maltiness to come out as it warmed. The taste took all of those previously mentioned flavors and added a nice sweet maltiness coating my taste buds. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was there. The normal harshness of an AIPA was there assaulting my tongue very good. Overall, what a great beer all around. Well worthy of having again.",3.99
Abrasive Ale,A - nice golden amber semi clear color with an off white head that sticks and leaves a nice lacing,4.58
Abrasive Ale,"Trying this at home now to give it a fair shot. Pours a golden blonde with hints of honey, light haze. Head starts off at a webby 2 fingers, then recedes somewhat quickly to a bubbly ring. ",3.77
Abrasive Ale,Poured from a pint can. The beer pours a nice orangish color with a lot of small floaties. The smell is huge citrus with orange and grapefruit. The taste follows with a small malt backbone. Overall a great beer that easy too easy to drink for the ABV.,4.25
Abrasive Ale,L: Nice orange amber color.,4.63
Abrasive Ale,"The beer looks golden and clear. It also has a great head that last a long time. The smell of the beer is floral and hoppy. The taste of the beer is full and hoppy. Very good taste. The feel of the beer lingers awhile which is great. Overall, I'm glad I found this beer. It is great!",4.43
Abrasive Ale,"16oz, canned 11/15/16; acquired in trade with my friend, Derek ",4.36
Abrasive Ale,From can.,4.08
Abrasive Ale,"Can dated 10/26/16 into a tumbler glass. Pours hazy bronze with finger of medium density khaki head that had moderate retention and left windshield lacing. Nose is dominated by pine, followed by dank, and subtle citrus. Seems different than a lot of the other reviews, likely due to age. Taste is heavy citrus and pine, traditional 'West side in da house', lots of grapefruit which is fine by me . Plenty of bitterness on the finish, lingers a bit. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, moderate carbonation, and some astringency on the finish that left a very subtle tingling (though guess that could be from the ABV also). Even though it was as fresh as I'd like, I was quite fond of this beer. Can only imagine how great it must be fresh!",4.42
Abrasive Ale,"Pours a pretty opaque orange to burnt orange with white foamy head that fades to a ring. Small amount of bubbles rising. No real lacing to mention. The aroma is of tropical fruits, citrus, pine, and a little caramel. Building bitterness, and a slight ammonia-like quality in the flavor, I usually get this from Simcoe....don't know if they use it in this brew? Sweetness mid palate with those tropical fruit and citrus notes. Some slight caramel malt throughout the sip. Above average carbonation, medium full body, and quite dry, through and through. Overall, pretty nice DIPA.",4.19
Abrasive Ale,"pours a pale gold with a solid head, lighter than expected. still looks great",4.68
Abrasive Ale,Poured from a 16 oz can into a snifter. Canned 10/26/16.,4.77
Mocha Wednesday,"Pours a dark and muddy brown with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is okay. Aroma is mocha, toffee, caramel, coffee and soothing bourbon with a kiss of char. Roasty and toasty malts form a resoundingly steady base. Flavor profile is mocha, toffee, caramel and then a searing slice of bourbon and heat. After the heat subsides, the focus goes back to lightly sugary with a heavy malt base. Malts come by way of roasty and toasty. Sweetness comes from more mocha and chocolate than try to outweigh the lingering bourbon heat. Mouth feel is thick and full with a velvety, heavy creamery texture. Overall, hot and booze with some kisses and glimpses of sweet. Balance may be a strong word here, as it veers pretty far on both sides of the heat vs. sweet spectrum, but it does all net out within each dynamic sip. ",4.32
Mocha Wednesday,"Tasted from 2016 bottle. Pours dark brown with light khaki colored head. Aroma with lots of Caramel and bourbon notes along with cocoa. Very sweet on taste and it hides the ridiculously high ABV extremely well. Brown sugar, molasses, caramel, chocolate and just a hint of coffee. Huge beer that’s very well done.",4.42
Mocha Wednesday,Bottled 11/24/14; drank 2/26/16 @ Harvest Hop Haus. ,3.9
Mocha Wednesday,2015 Bottle. 18.6% ABV.,4.35
Mocha Wednesday,This massive beer has been in my cellar for almost a year. The super high ABV would allow this beast to age for several more years. The beer is 50 degrees and served in a tulip glass. A semi-hard pour produced a one finger head that dissipated quickly. The beer is SRM 37 a dark brown nearly black beer that is opaque. The has carbonation bubbles pooling in the middle of the beer. Overall a good appearance. With high ABV I did not expect to see a lasting head or lacing. ,4.69
Mocha Wednesday,"It seems like I'm always a day behind when I drink these. Who cares anyway, it's like underwear with the days on them. You honestly telling me you don't just feel like wearing Saturday some Mondays? Anyways, I'm pouring from a 750 ml. 2016 bottle into a snifter. This beer pours out just like the others, way lighter than beers similar in the style. Brown in color with highlights all the way through. The smell is warming bourbon with a mocha backdrop. Raisins and plums evident as well. The taste comes in with that same burning sensation and provides dark fruit notes. A very nice chocolately finish. There is some coffee and mocha presence in there, but for the main part it's slight and if not advertised, I think most would just think of a bourbon barrel aged stout. The mouthfeel is thick, chewy and great for the style. Overall, this has probably been my favorite of these so far. But still nothing blowing me out of the water. I guess I'll just keep swimming.",4.24
Mocha Wednesday,Thanks to Chris the local guy for this 750ML bottle. Sampled this previously but never sat down with a full pour & very happy to do so. Split with my wife. ,4.7
Mocha Wednesday,"Original black Tuesday is better to me, but this is better than grey Monday. A great tourist beer, as it takes you on a novel taste journey. Really opens up with a bit of temperature.",4.46
Mocha Wednesday,750ml bottle into tulip. Bottled 3/2/16.,4.22
Mocha Wednesday,"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 1/27/2017. Pours nearly opaque dark brown/black color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy khaki head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin ring of lace. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big nutty dark roasted coffee, milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, vanilla, cream, fudge, brown sugar, maple syrup, almond, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark bread; with lighter notes of coconut, marshmallow, molasses, licorice, smoke, dark fruit, pepper, and roast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Mild increasing booze in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Taste of huge nutty dark roasted coffee, milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, vanilla, cream, fudge, brown sugar, maple syrup, almond, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark bread; with lighter notes of coconut, marshmallow, molasses, licorice, smoke, dark fruit, pepper, and roast/oak earthiness. Light-moderate bourbon/oak spiciness and light roast/char bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of nutty coffee, milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, vanilla, cream, fudge, brown sugar, maple syrup, almond, bourbon, toasted oak, dark bread, coconut, marshmallow, light licorice/molasses/dark fruit, and roast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from bourbon/oak spiciness and roast bitterness. Medium carbonation and very full body; with a smooth, creamy/silky, and lightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Lightly increasing warmth of 19.9%, with mild lingering barrel booziness after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged imperial stout! All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on slowly for the huge ABV. Bruery stouts always seem to have a class of their own on the flavor profile. Not as deeply roasty or charred on black/roasted malts like some others; but still extremely rich and complex. Outstanding barrel integration and balance; without feeling overly boozy, tannic, or drying. Very similar to the base beer with big levels of fruity/nutty coffee complexity. A highly enjoyable offering.",4.2
Mocha Wednesday,"Giant killer beer that has the amazing aroma of chocolate, bourbon, coffee, oak, vanilla. Very sweet beer with lower carbonation. Tons of chocolate and coffee with strong bourbon. Amazingly this beer hides it's monstrous ABV. There is a little alcohol heat at the end but it is balanced. This is an awesome beer.",4.49
Mocha Wednesday,Cola black with a thin finger of fizzy dark-tan head that's quick to dissipate into a crown.,4.06
Mocha Wednesday,"This actually looks like coffee, except for a webby tan foaminess that quickly dies to next to nothing but a gold chain.",3.69
Mocha Wednesday,"2017 vintage (thanks Mike!) . Pours two shade shy of black with lovely ruby highlights when backlit. No head whatsoever on this beer. Nose reveals big ethanol notes (enough to ignite your nose hairs) followed by dark malts. Taste expresses toffee, ethanol and some peppery notes, on a dark malty backbone. Mouthfeel is quite thin with a mild carbonation. This beer is hot!. Overall impressions - young and thin. Let this one sit for a few years.",3.72
Mocha Wednesday,Random preface - Birthday beer. It's a 2016 I've had Cellared for 10 months now but am eager to try it after recently having black tuesday. The aforementioned being an almost transcendent experience slow sipping over several hours. I didn't quite imagine my birthday being as boring as today was when I took a vacation day for tomorrow... but alas I'll make sure it wasn't in vain by facing this monster of a beer.,4.05
Mocha Wednesday,Appearance - The beer was a deep murky brown color. ,4.59
Mocha Wednesday,This is decieving for a stout. It's more of a dark amber color and has a nice chocolate aroma. Flavor is nice mocha soaked bourbon. Body is thinner than you would expect but this is still pretty delicious.,4.21

Mocha Wednesday,2016 Vintage.,4.51
Mocha Wednesday,"2016 offering served in a tulip glass. Sweet Mexican sugary taste up front, w some butterscotch and raisin. Defiinitely oaky backbone, slight bitter taste. Mild expresso taste, w coffee on the nose. Tasted like a piece of fudge melted in your mouth, as you died and went to heaven. Very boozy, watch out.",4.49
Mocha Wednesday,overall the class of the night of the bruery tasting night. a great looking dark pour from the bottle. smells of coffee and chocolate with a little sweet caramel flooding from the glass gets the mouth watering. taste fully follows the nose and does not leave you looking for more. feel is very good with an nice coating left in the mouth.,4.71
Mocha Wednesday,"Pours pretty much the same as Black Tuesday (base beer here) with a jet black thick body and a brown head in the 1/2"" range. Aroma rocks the coffee hard, and then its all bourbon fudge after that.",4.54
Mocha Wednesday,"Had this last night at the Bruery Terreux. A 2017, but i have a few bottles that i plan to open at different times in the coming years. This was an opportunity to try it fresh as I've been told the coffee taste tends to drop off the longer a bottle ages.",4.55

Scaled Way Up,"Pours hazy, yellow gold in color with 1/3 inch head. Taste is orange pith, herbal hops, and tangerine. Medium heavy bodied...The body really works for this beer, slightly bitter, with moderate carbonation. Very good beer. Juicy but not overly so. Would get this again.",4.57

Scaled Way Up,Thanks for the can Kevin!,4.28
Scaled Way Up,"Pours out super hazed pineapple juice like color, thin bright white head recedes quickly, minimal to no lacing. Pretty punchy aromas of grapefruit, lemon, and mango, some pithy and dank green notes as well. On palate is acidic grapefruit and orange juice, pine needles, harsh and almost chalky green herbal quality, hop burn, no real malt to speak of. Mouthfeel is decent but suffers as a result of the chalky and harsh aspects of the flavor profile. Overall this was a decent beer, but not top notch. Had multiple cans and one was compared blind to TH C44 ... no contest at all.",4.2
Scaled Way Up,16oz can dated 2/9/18.,4.51
Scaled Way Up,"On draft at Trillium-Canton. Appearance is basically orange juice both in color and opaqueness. Tropical fruit and great aromatic aroma. Fruity. Pineapple, mango, peach and juicy. Good mouthfeel with a bit of a dry, mild bitter hop bite at the end. Exceptional.",4.73

Scaled Way Up,Look: Yellow hazy with small white head. Has low carbonation.,4.71
Scaled Way Up,Very cloudy straw appearance with white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a strong citrus. Taste is also a fairly strong citrus that is very pleasant.,4.49
Scaled Way Up,Giving this one the benefit of the doubt because the bottle was slightly old. But overall still the usual murky fantasticness I've come to expect from Trillium.,4.38
Scaled Way Up,Big thanks to @my_knew_craft for splitting this one with me!,4.94
Scaled Way Up,"pours a gorgeous murky yellow. smell is big pineapple, orange, and pine, some light peach as well. taste is HUGE and pungent: clementines, pineapples, mangoes, peaches, dank weed and grass, no malt apparent. just the very slightest bit of booze but it balances it. mouthfeel is awesome, killer DIPA fuzz. perfect brew, I know they said it was a one time brew, but this may my favorite double IPA from trillium. please brew it again!! if not, Scaled Up will suffice.... i guess......",4.87
Scaled Way Up,I was finally able to track this one down… It was definitely not easy as it released a while ago. I knew it would still be amazing as Trillium remains juicy and Dank for months unlike some other New England IPAs that fade in a few weeks,4.74
Scaled Way Up,"Great beer, it's a shame it was a one time offering by Trillium. But if you're lucky enough to get it definitely try it. Delicious beer. Smells great tastes wonderful, make this again Trillium!",4.65

Scaled Way Up,"750 ml bottle. Pours cloudy light orange, big fluffy white head, lasts, tiny bubbly lacing everywhere. Citrusy pineapple aroma jumps out, just wanna keep sniffing this one. Taste bursts with pineapple and mango juiciness, earthy herbal nets round out the taste. Just enough sweet cracker malt sweetness. Thin to medium slick mouthfeel with dry crisp ending. Wow this brew is outstanding!",4.69
Scaled Way Up,A: Another super cloudy beer from Trillium. Hazy kind of dull apricot color with a thin white head.,4.59
Moment Of Clarity,I really don't get the hype behind this beer. This is big and sweet with a small tan head (even after the hard pour) into my gold TH teku. ,3.78
Moment Of Clarity,"16oz can, served in a Tree House snifter glass. Pours a dark opaque black body, one finger mocha head, good retention, a bit of lacing. Smell is milk chocolate, thick roast, sweet maple. It's sweet. Not much coffee behind it, but it has a bit of dusky chocolate, like baking chocolate or something similar to that. It's fairly fudgy but not roasty or bitter. Flavour brongs up front maple, milk chocolate, a bit of roast, and more chocolate. It's smooth up front, but has a bit more baker's chocolate, a mild earthy bitterness on the backend. It's very tasty and melds well with the added adjuncts. Full bodied, smooth, creamy and even a bit nutty on the backend. An overall excellent adjunct stout. There is just enough maple and chocolate to satisfy my mildly sweet tooth without being cloying or overwhelmingly sugary. It's delicious and almost ice-cream like.",4.44
Moment Of Clarity,Appearance: Poured jet black and thick with a very rich luscious brown head. ,4.54

Moment Of Clarity,"Silky smooth--you'd think it was a nitro pour, but it wasn't. Big maple flavor throughout, accompanied by chocolate and coffee in support.

Moment Of Clarity,"Nose: Maple Syrup, Doughy French Toast, Fresh Cold Brew Coffee",4.11
Moment Of Clarity,"Gone are the days of Good Morning; even so, this brew has given me a glimmer of the past despite it being a milk stout. Lots of maple flavor dominates the palate in a way that isn’t over-the-top. Mouthfeel is a bit thin despite it packing a very sweet profile. MOC is a beer that I welcome at all times of the year.",4.69
Moment Of Clarity,Poured gently into a pint glass resulting in a surprisingly prominent head of foam on top of a jet black body. Head retention is more persistent than I personally expected. Nice looking beer.,4.18

Moment Of Clarity,"Pours black and viscous from the can. Dark brown bubbles cascade up, forming a densely packed, rocky, tall, brown colored head.

Opaque and no visible carbonation. ",4.44
Moment Of Clarity,My first review after using this site as a resource for many years.,3.85
Moment Of Clarity,"Traded for this beer recently, as the date on the bottom of the can read 1/10/19 with ""THE MOMENTS ARE MINE IF I CAN JUST SEIZE THE DAY"" written above it. The name of this beer was a bit of a misnomer as the liquid and taste were anything but clear as this reminded me of something that I'd have in the morning along with pancakes and cereal. If you're looking for a beer to have at the crack of dawn without being overly weak, then you've found your match here!",4.38

Delicious.",4.65

Gggreennn!,Tall can from the source ...bottom tells me it was canned 10-8-19,4.43
Gggreennn!,"Pours a very turbid golden hue. No chance of light getting through. Orange and tangerine on the nose. It's got kind of an artificial pez character or at least something artificial. It's dry with some citrus character, but it's got that game over, fatal, acidic hop burn on the finish. Nate, those hops would've been better served in another batch of Green or perhaps Eureka. This is a dud. This has turned Green into an abomination.",3.24
Gggreennn!,"Canned 10/08/19, so exactly six days ago. ",4.31
Gggreennn!,"16oz can, Tree House snifter glass. Same appearance as Green- pulpy golden yellow body, unfiltered and hazy, one finger frothy white head, great retention and lacing. Smell is massive tropical fruit, mildly spicy herbal and floral notes, grapefruit and a bit of resin. It has that richness of regular Green, but the fruitiness is taken up a notch. Flavour follows to an extent- it tastes very much like Green but with a bigger tropical fruit and spicy hop bite to it. It has even more flavour to it than Green, which is kind of crazy considering how multifaceted and delicious Green is. It's a bit less nuanced, being the only drawback of whatever they did to amp up the underlying recipe. Medium bodied, soft and creamy, perfectly carbonated. Another winner from Tree House, but I would be just as happy with regular Green, which is not a bad thing with regards to this particular beer.",4.56
Gggreennn!,"Another incredible, outstanding NE style IPA from Tree House. Canned date 7/30/19. Juicy, delicious, hazy, balanced, soft, dank. Just excellent. Pours a great looking very hazy orange-yellow color with some nice fluffy white head and fairly thick spotty lingering lacing. Smells deeply of ripe fruity hops, mainly mango, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, orange, guava, passionfruit and melon. Also malt, vanilla, floral and herbal hops in the background. Taste follows the nose, great balance between the mildly bitter hops and sweeter malt backbone. Perfect amount of dankness. Smooth, sticky, mild, coats the palate. Perfect amount of carbonation. One of my top 3 beers from this amazing brewery.",4.49
Gggreennn!,Canned on 7/30. Poured to TH Glass on 8/6. Was 2 cans per person limit.,4.62
Gggreennn!,"Pours an opaque straw yellow with a finger+ of fluffy white head. Aroma has some pineapple and citrus pith upfront with a healthy dose of green melon and cantaloupe. Flavor mirrors the aroma with a heavy emphasis on the melon and cantaloupe notes, finishes a bit sweet. Good mouthfeel, medium body and carbonation. Overall this is super tasty and has the classic Tree House house character/yeast profile that always expresses to me as melon/cantaloupe.",4.61

Bright tropical fruit that quickly gives way to hefty orange and orange peel. Back end has tingly orange peel bitterness. It's a little over the top. Medium body. Almost no malt flavor makes it through. Ridiculous, but I'm enjoying it.",3.7
Gggreennn!,"A thinner head at first glance and the color of orange juice, very fruity in the nose and first taste, feels soft and smooth on the palate and more drinkable than typical New England IPAs. A good overall drinkable beer from Tree House.",4.75

Gggreennn!,"If Green was a milkshake, it would be this beer. It's almost too thick feeling, but tastes ridiculous. More pineapple than on Green and slightly less bitterness (not that Green is very bitter). This beer is a whole different experience to almost anything out there. ",4.69
Gggreennn!,"Pours hazy, orange-brown in color with 1/3 inch head. Taste is big pineapple with starfruit, bitter orange juice, and slight guava. Heavy bodied, low carbonation, sweet start with slightly bitter finish. This is a creamier/ heavier bodied version of Green with orange juice bitterness at the finish. The heavier body really adds to the beer. Makes me want regular Green to compare it to. An amazing IPA. Green amplified in all the right ways. One of the best ipas I have had.",5

I had never tried this till now because every time I came across it, the bottles were 3 months old or worse. Turns out I wasn’t missing much. It’s like an American Barleywine for the most part. Enjoyable enough overall, but wouldn’t buy again.",3.82
Permanent Funeral,"My relationship with 3 Floyds hops has been…tumultuous over the years, so I’ve never bothered to pick this up. Welp, here we are. 22 oz. bottle split with my wife. ",4.03

Cheers.",4.44
Permanent Funeral,"22oz bottled 11/16/18 (17 days ago) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp. The beer pours mostly bright orange tinted light amber with sticky off white head. The head recedes to an island and leaves plenty of lacing. The aroma is major citrus with tangerine, grapefruit, orange and lime all coming through. The taste is more of the same with a semisweet start of candied orange, tangerine, and pine laid over a soft honey malt background. The bitterness really comes out mid-palate on and the finish is mostly dry due to the huge hop oil shellac that coats the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and adequately carbonated. Overall, excellent. Very well made, beautiful, fragrant, delicious DIPA.",4.5
Permanent Funeral,"8/1/18: $12 22 oz bottle purchased at Three Floyds Munster, two pours into pint glass. Orange pour, thin white head, heavy carbonation. Strong citrus lemon hops aroma. Very strong dry taste and mouth feel, excellent hops blend, balanced with citrus. Drinks smoother and easier than the strong ABV. Solid mouth feel, bitter, carbonation and dryness holds, Overall excellent offering, worth the trip to Munster!",4.35
Permanent Funeral,"5 ounce pour at 3 Floyds in Munster. Nice dark golden orange colour with fruity aroma - grapefruit, hoppy resinous, a little floral. The taste starts more with a sweet malt followed by big citrus notes then pushing into piney flavours. Full bodied mouthfeel to a well balanced finish - pleasant but not over the top bitterness for a 100 IBU beer. Fantastic.",4.34
Permanent Funeral,This is my most favorite beer. It is very smooth with fruity overtone. A beer with a much higher alcohol content and should not be drunk quickly. If you can find this beer anywhere (it's a rarity) enjoy!,4.94
Permanent Funeral,"I love a creamy, citrusy IPA and to me this is the premier example. The mouth feel is perfectly creamy and thick with a hoppy, complex nose. It finishes strong all the way through the aftertaste.",4.86
Permanent Funeral,Now then! This is the real deal. Pours a nice amber/ golden color,4.25
Permanent Funeral,my first BA reivew. This is the beer I've been yearning for months. Was there a bad crop of hops out there or something? This is really balanced. No medicinal aftertaste that seems to have plagued even my perennial favorites this year. Restored my faith. Maybe God is ok with me loving beer after all. Had my doubts for a while ,4.63
Permanent Funeral,"I received this beer from a BIF Lloyd Dobler, thank you. The beer is FAF from the grapevine. The beer is 48 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The beer has a one finger creamy and airy white head. The color of the beer is SRM 10 a medium amber with copper hues. The clarity of is a touch opaque with a few carbonation bubbles. The head has poor retention and no lacing on the glass. ",4.48
Permanent Funeral,Thanks to a stalwart BA who gifted this monster to me recently.,4.37
Permanent Funeral,"Hazy dark straw appearance with a one finger off white head. Dank, earthy, piny nose that is on the shy side. Maybe as it warms it will get more expressive. Taste mirrors the nose with plenty of earthy, resiny pine along with hints of citrus. Bready malt plays a fairly big role in overall taste. Pleasant bitterness lingers on a long finish. Mouth feel is very creamy. Glad to have finally gotten a hold of this beer - it's darn tasty and deserves its high rating.",4.13
Permanent Funeral,"Pouring from a bomber bottle into a pint glass. This beer pours out slightly hazy, but not New England hazy. It's a golden orange color and forms a half finger of white crown. The smell is dank and juicy with citrus notes. Honey like sweetness coming through as well. The taste comes in with pine at the very beginning but quickly fades into a juicy citrus and then again into the honey like sweetness that it finishes with. Sticky and wet mouthfeel. This is so good, FFF has been doing this good shit for so long.",4.5
Permanent Funeral,"wow I can't believe this is at 10.50% really smooth for such a high abv. Very bright, very smooth, good citrus nose on the body. great hop taste. Delicious.",4.65

Permanent Funeral,Poured a hazy dark orange with a dense looking white head.,4.44
Permanent Funeral,Tasted from draft. Pours hazy gold with white head. Aroma is citrus and some dank resin. Taste is well balanced with great clean bitter flavor. Flavors of melon and citrus fruit. Excellent beer but I think I like Zombie Dust better.,4.6
Permanent Funeral,"L- Brilliant orange with a large, foamy off-white head with little carbonation.",4.93
Permanent Funeral,22 ounce bomber bottled 5/10/2017 and poured into a 3 Floyds pint glass and consumed on 5/17/2017.,4.07
Permanent Funeral,"Pours a clouded orange with two and a half fingers of off-white head that retains extremely well. Just a little lacing left behind. Aroma is pine, resin, citrus, and lemongrass. Extremely hoppy, but well developed. Flavor profile is resin, pine, citrus, lemongrass, and herbal. Lots and lots of hop notes, which include a discernible bitterness. Bready biscuit malts provide some support. Mouth feel is medium-thick, with a filling, grainy texture. Overall, a huge DIPA with loads and loads of hop notes. Not close to bitter free, but still well executed. ",4.41
Permanent Funeral,Finally got my hands on a bomber. 22oz bottle. Cannot read the date but I am assuming it is relatively fresh as my beer store buddy just got it in today. ,3.82

Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,"
as much as I love Sump, this is better..a fantastic barrel aged coffee stout",4.44
Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,"Syrupy, soft, smooth sipper. Like liquid chocolate cake in a glass. Coffee is there, with burnt caramel and dark cocoa. Sweet, minimal carbonation, sweet and velvety. Boozy in a way, but only because you know the alcohol is there - it's hidden, blending with whiskey tones to make one of the best beers I've ever had. The smell is indulgent and dessert-y, intoxicating. Look is midnight black, just like coffee should be.",4.73

Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,"Smell: Straight Fudge. Big Milk chocolate, dark chocolate. Fresh roasted espresso beans, vanilla, coconut, bourbon, oak, a little pop of dark fruit. This is just a straight chocolate bomb mixed with coffee and barrel. This beer smells like a chocolate paradise.",5

Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,"rye barrel aged sump, on tap no less! a real special brew that i have been looking forward to trying for ages now, and only am just getting my first crack. its inky slick black from the tap, highly viscous, shiny, and relatively still after a moment. pretty shine, brimming with black coffee in the aroma. to me, this isnt espresso or cold brew or anything, but distinctly black coffee, almost oozy strong. the nose also shows the spicy sweet rye, with vanilla from the oak and the slight harshness of the whiskey itself, some fusel alcohol, and a wonderful thick black barley malt base that i remember from the original, this barrel aged version has been transformed but not compromised. i love the coffee in the flavor, it has some acidity which i like with all this body, but it has a simple nature to it, quality beans brewed well, but seems less fancy than other coffee beers, just lots and lots of it. the barrel is strong, this is both woody and boozy, and also obviously rye and not bourbon whiskey, less corny and sweet, more character from the grain than that, and the oak with the coffee and the charred grain makes this mighty complex and delicious. its almost too thick and strong to drink a lot of, i find myself lipping it slowly, taking in no more than an ounce or two at a time, savoring it before swallowing it, and almost needing to recover a moment before going back in for more. its special and unique, but man is it sturdy and strong, not for everyone i wouldnt think, and a somewhat more bold and assertive stout than many others in its field. tastes and feels more like 15% abv! loved it, but this one is for sharing! now if i could only find some barrel aged abraxas i would feel like i have the highest perennial beers on lock! this was delightfully enormous.",4.46
Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,"Pours jet black with a touch of mocha head. Nose has big barrel notes up front followed by espresso and dark chocolate. As it warms, you can pick up more roast and some dark fruit elements. Taste is not as coffee forward as regular sump....the age and the barrel has taken away some of the familiar taste. The barrel, chocolate, roast, and coffee are very well balanced. Feel is thick and velvety with moderately low carbonation. Overall, an excellent example of a BA coffee stout but just a tick below BCBCS and some of Perennial's other BA stout offerings.",4.61

Susan,"Perfect pour from a growler, small fluffy head, lacing all the way down the glass, hazy amber.",4.65
Susan,"a classic from these guys that i am only finally getting to drink now. it may have been a game changer when it first came out, but it certainly isnt anything new anymore. this balance of heavy dry hopping over a hazy base with some substance is now everywhere, and even the hop profile itself seems somewhat classic, more northwestern than southern hemisphere, but its the degree of refinement that has me blown away, which is more manifest in the mouthfeel than anywhere else in this now famous ipa. it is both expressively carbonated and bone dry, while also being drinkable but substantial, round medium body but fast finishing, the right elements of the hops linger too, no vegetal bite or over bittered harshness. it does have some bitterness though, not all juice, and the grapefruity piney flavors, almost assuredly simcoe derived, do have some resolution, but its the between the lines nuances of pineapple, papaya, and juniper that turn me on here. so alive from the tap, almost chuggable for what it is, probably ahead of its time when it was introduced, not decidedly in the middle of whats hot, but this is a quality league or two above just about everything else, including the other ones the nerds all line up for and freak out about. from a flavor standpoint, its great but not revolutionary, but through the lens of quality, its as good as it gets!",4.33
Susan,"On tap Mission Dolores, Brooklyn. ",4.18
Susan,"Draught: this one pours a murky, golden color. There was a wisp of a white head and some lacing. Nice nose! Grapefruit, tropical and citrus hops. The taste is very good. A faint bitterness, and lots of juicy hops. They blend together to make something that is just excellent!",4.53

Susan,25 cl pour at the brewery. Pours a hazy pale orange in color with a finger+ of white head. Aroma and taste have some stone and tropical fruits with a bit of cantaloupe and a heavy earthy note. Everything sounds like something I'd love but this one is just very good as opposed to great.,4.03
Susan,"750ml swing top growler poured into shaker pint, poured on 8/30 best by of 9/6.",4
Susan,"on draft, in a shaker pint glass",4.18
Susan,"The appearance was a nice looking hazy bronzed orange color with a bar pour’s kind of slim white head that dissipated within less than a minute leaving some messy lacing. The smell started off with some sweet peach, light apricots, light pine blend bittersweet and sound off together really nicely. The taste was bittersweet all of the way through in the previously mentioned flavors running into a nice semi-sweet to bitter citrus aftertaste. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice bittersweet feel on my tongue. Sessionable enough to want to have with food. Overall, I’d have this again. Its pretty good.",3.99

Susan,On tap in DC at Churchkey,4.59
Susan,Full pour at CK. Pretty gross. Smells great but has a nasty vegetal note that dominates the flavor. Had this same flavor in an off batch of Edward last year.,3.72
Susan,"Hazy golden yellow, medium head. Dry fruit aroma, apricot, a bit of pineapple with classic HF floral nose on it. Smells like walking through a flower patch after a summer rain. Tons of peach & pineapple upfront, mid palate brings mango and kiwi, some very faint honeysuckle and hibiscus way at the end, finishes with perfect amount of bitter hop and pineapple again. Just a wonderfully delicate citrus hop beer, like ""juice"" but still beer unlike some of these lactose sugar ""juice bombs"" out there. A standard for IPAs. A rare perfect 5 beer in my book.",5
Susan,After a weekend of tasting some of the top 100 beers on a tour around ,4.93
Susan,On tap at Manhattan in Burlington.,4.5
Susan,"Poured into a tulip. Very hazy and slightly turbid on the pour with a golden straw color. A modest bright white head that left fairly quickly but left the glass with some sturdy, splotchy laces. The nose was bright: sweet grapefruit, grassiness, mango, and a bit of blueberry. I noticed the grapefruit on the palate first. Not bracingly bitter but not ""soft"" either. The mid-palate was more earthy with pine, berries, grass, and dry bready malt. The finish was clean with a rising bitterness that framed the taste for me. Nice and light-feeling on the palate despite it's massive flavor, but not at all thin. A fantastic beer.",4.51
Susan,"Completely hazed golden with dense white head, strong lacing. Tropical nose mainly pineapple, other berries maybe. Taste is bitter, not much malt presence, grapefruit juice in an ale. Mouth coating resiny feel with below average body and carbonation.",4.33
Susan,Hazy orange pour with an inch of white fluffy head,4.7
Susan,"On tap at Malt & Mold. Poured a completely opaque golden orange with a nice foamy head to it. The nose is very fruity with citrus playing lead. The flavor follows the nose, definitely a juice bomb with the slightest amount of bitterness and malt. The feel is medium, decent carbonation, and a quick finish. This one has been on my list for a while and glad to finally be having it. A northeast IPA done to perfection.",4.6

Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,"Review #1500!!! A massive thanks goes out to cmrillo for bringing this one out during his own 40 Beers* @ 40 Birthday Bash! Can’t believe I FINALLY got to try this one!!! 2008 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured pitch black with a minimal tan head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, dark chocolate, vanilla, sweet alcohol, and roasted malt. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, vanilla, wood, sweet alcohol, and milk chocolate. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. This was another one that I was shocked to see come out at the birthday party. This was sampled directly after Stormaktsporter. There was a pretty good difference in this one from the base brew. There was a lot more presence of the vanilla with an addition of various chocolate aspects. The cigar aspect I picked up on in the base brew had disappeared, but what replaced it in both the flavor and aroma was just plain excellent. So glad I got the chance to finally try this one and would love to do so over and over again.",4.55

Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,"250ml Bottle First try in 2009 a 2006 Vintage. I can’t deny that I had very high expectations and really wanted for it to fulfill them. Did it ? Hell yeah ! 2006 Bottle, served in a wonderful De Molen snifter. It pours pitch black, thick and oily in the glass creating a small but wonderful deep brown head. The wonderful roasted aroma, with the coffee and chocolate notes and a slight hint of vanilla, tar and wood. So complex and as it warms it becomes even better But nothing can prepare you for the taste that is about to follow. The roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, wood notes, some distant ripe fruit. So many flavors , so wonderfully balanced together. What really amazes me though is how easily it drinks despite it’s ABV, you feel like you can have (in my dreams) many many glasses, which is rarely the case with big Imp stouts. I can’t give it anything but a perfect score and I really doubt that I will do this for another beer (certainly hope so though :D ). ",5

The Abyss,"The abyss pours a black color, small lacong tan head. Aroma is rich, dry oak. Flavor is dry very rich, hi ts of nature and lictorice. Great heavy thick body. Overall great beer very flavorfull.",4.55
The Abyss,The Abyss 2015 Reserve,4.56
The Abyss,"Poured a motor oil black with minimal tan head that left lace spots. Aroma has minimal booziness with a mix of roasted malts, bitter chocolate, hints of vanilla and dark cherry (which I assume is the licorice (black cherry licorice?)). The beer has an oaky smoothness with a mix of chocolate and cherry/licorice like sweetness, balanced by a roasted coffee edge and a note of booze.",4

The Abyss,Review/rating logged about two months after having it.,4.13
The Abyss,"pitch black, fine beige foam",4.04
The Abyss,"This is a beer that I haven't previously reviewed because I never it liked as much as the score indicates I should (it's got a strange bitterness to me). This time, I opened a 2014 bottle in 2019, and though it's slightly better, it still has an odd bitterness for me.",4.01
The Abyss,"2015 vintage enjoyed February 2019. Pours a deep black with short lived tight brown head. Aroma is complex with molasses, dark chocolate, licorice, but with strong notes of dark fruits.",4.34

The Abyss,"Date: Bottled on 10/30/17, savored on 12/05/18.",4.75
The Abyss,"Pours a deep, thick black with no head or lacing.",4
The Abyss,"A very nice imperial stout but the stronger flavors of raisin and licorice were just a little too much for me. Pours a deep, rich dark black color with great dark tan head and sheets of lacing. Smells of deep rich chocolate and coffee, along with fainter dark stone fruit, malt and caramel. Tastes of deep dark roast coffee, dark chocolate mocha, vanilla, caramel, raisin, molasses, brown sugar, malt and licorice. Just too much raisin and licorice for me. Smooth mild mouthfeel, surprisingly not that creamy. Clean and silky, just enough carbonation. A strong beer but a little disappointing given the huge ratings and reviews here.",4.18
The Abyss,"A lot toastier and maltier with some good dark chocolate taste. Not sweet like so many in this style but in a good way. Oddly, I drank the bottle over two days and it actually tasted better after being exposed for a day.",4.5
The Abyss,"Smells like hot caramel. Looks quite alluring in a sniffer. Wow. Intense flavor here. Obvious roasted malts, but something else...maybe kahlua-like. Very thick. Super alcoholic. Delicious. Like hot fudge. Rich.",4.39
The Abyss,2016 Bottle. Pours a pitch black color with a small amount of caramel colored head. Laced the glass with each sip. Scent was roasted malt and some excess booze. Taste was strong of cherry and a slight roasted malt aftertaste. Smooth for the ABV and alcohol scent.,4.31
The Abyss,"Abyss 2015. Pours a pitch black color with a small brown head. There is decent retention with good lacing, Deep roasted aroma with red wine and slight cherry. Smooth taste - mild molasses, roasted, red wine and cherry. Medium to heavy bodied with mild carbonation.",4.47
The Abyss,Beautiful dark and rich looking Beer. Good thick and creamy head. Great lacing. Rich aromas of molasses and licorice and so many to ponder. Taste is lots of molasses and enough bitterness to know this is a beer. The alcohol is strong and that adds to the overall flavor. Overall this what we dream about in craft beer. On draft at Ron’s Corner Tavern. The 2016 version I’m told.,4.43
Darkness,"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 9/25/2019. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky tan head with amazing retention, that reduces to a large cap that lasts. Thick foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Amazing appearance. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, orange, grapefruit, citrus peel/rind, wood, peppercorn, pine, roasted nuts, toasted biscuit, and dark bread/crust; with lighter notes of licorice, smoke, charcoal, leather, tobacco, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Mild increasing booze as it warms, but not overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/black/roast/bready malts, citrus/earthy hops, and fruity yeast notes; with big strength. Taste of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, orange, grapefruit, citrus peel/rind, wood, peppercorn, pine, roasted nuts, toasted biscuit, and dark bread/crust; with lighter notes of licorice, smoke, charcoal, leather, tobacco, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery, roast, charred bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, orange, grapefruit, citrus peel/rind, wood, peppercorn, pine, roasted nuts, toasted biscuit, dark bread/crust, licorice, smoke, charcoal, leather, tobacco, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/black/roast/bready malts, citrus/earthy hops, and fruity yeast flavors; with an awesome hop/char bitter/sweet balance; and no minimal acrid/astringent flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety/bready, and fairly sticky/chalky/resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Mild increasing warmth of 12% after the finish. Overall this is an amazing Russian imperial stout. All around amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/black/roast/bready malts, citrus/earthy hops, and fruity yeast flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV with the modestly bitter/charred/resinous/drying finish. Nicely soft, and not overly bitter/charred. Definitely needs a bit of age for the freshness. Perfectly balanced between super rich dark/black/roasted malts, citrus/earthy hops, and fruity yeast. Mild residual sweetness with lingering hop/char bitter dryness. A highly enjoyable offering, and amazing spot on style example as expected. Reminds me of Old Raspy a lot on the fresh hop intensity.",4.36
Darkness,I tried a bottle of this at the brewery whilst in town for a work conference with my co-workers. The beer poured an opaque dark and had thin tan head that did not leave much lacing. The scent had dark fruit and roast notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with roast malt base and dark fruit and raisin highlights. The mouthfeel was medium in body with smooth carbonation. Overall its a solid beer.,4.33
Darkness,"2016 version, Hades Cerberus bottle art which is superb. No abv indicated on the bottle, this is evidently a 12% RIS.",4.75
Darkness,2010 Vintage (Vampire artwork)... poured from a black waxed bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip,4.5
Darkness,"Tasted from bottle aged 4 years. Pours black with thick beige head. Aroma is raisins, cocoa and molasses. Thick and chewy. Lots of cherry on the flavor. Some coffee, cocoa, raisins. Awesome RIS.",4.73
Darkness,"Pours black with a finger of dense, khaki foam. Head retention as a whole is moderate, with the final ring lasting a long while after the pour. Aroma is roasty, toasty, nutty, caramely, bready malts with heavy raisins, molasses, brown sugar, and toffee. It smells sweet, and nears on a sickly cloying level of sweetness straight out of the fridge. As it warms, the heavy raisins and dark fruits subside a touch, and with the gritty roasty malt bitterness, reaches a more favorable balance. Flavor profile is raisins, plums, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, caramel, and smoke. Malts hit notes of roasty, toasty, nutty and caramely adding depth and darkness. Initially at fridge temperature, the balance is skewed towards a cloying level of sweetness, but as the beer warms, melds into a more favorable balance. A bit of residual malt bitterness helps taper the sweetness off the tongue at the end. Mouth feel is medium-thick, and turns to thick as the beer warms. It has a silty, very fine granular texture that adds to the weight of the experience. Overall, a stout with depth that remains dynamic every degree or so of temperature change. At the colder temperatures, it’s not much to talk about it, but as it nears the suggested serving temperatures, it really opens up and reveals its personality.",4.37
Darkness,"Thick, chewy, roasty beer with lots of vanilla, cherry, raisin and dark chocolate. The beer finishes bitter. Shell is the same as the taste. Since this is 4 years old (2015 version) I am not getting much coffee but really good anyway.",4.63
Darkness,"From the neck: ""10/27/16""",3.86
Darkness,"The sum of all parts is pretty excellent. Really complex stout with waves of licorice, tobacco, dark fruit and sweet toffee. Little bitter finish rounds it out. ",4.59
Darkness,A - Pours motor oil black with a two finger tan head. Decent amount of soapy lacing.,4.38
Darkness,On tap; poured into a snifter.,4.16
Darkness,"I was happy to receive this beer through a BIF last year. Today was a great day I am going crack it open. The waxed cap gave way to a hiss and then the Russian Imperial Stout found its way to my nostrils, the smell was intoxicating. The beer is 50 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour on the beer produced a two finger head with exceptional retention. The head medium tan dissipated slowly leaving heavy thick lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 38 dark brown nearly black. The beer is opaque. The beer has a beautiful appearance. ",4.53
Darkness,"2016 version. I found this at a liquor store just north of Minneapolis and I am drinking it now because it's -35 degrees outside and getting colder. Thanks Fargo, ND for amazing drinking weather.",4.43
Darkness,On tap at Mikkeller & Friends in Copenhagen.,4.43
Darkness,Pours pitch black with a brown head.,4.42
Darkness,Jet black beer in a glass. Dark khaki head with a 2 finger head (aggressive pour). Laces the glass well. ,4.5
Darkness,"My quest is to try as many Russian Imperial Stouts as I can before I die, and find the best one. This one is now in the top two. Outstanding flavor. Kicks your ass like any superior RIS should. Worth every dollar I paid.",4.87
Darkness,"Pours a thick viscous black with a tan finger head that leaves substantial lacing. BIG aroma of dark (almost baker's) chocolate and cherries. A huge, complex flavor profile includes figs, raisins, dank earth, tree bark, light roast coffee, and dark chocolate. Smooth, silky, full body with moderate carbonation. The best example of the style I've ever had. Absolute perfection.",5
Darkness,A-Pours a very dark opaque color with a generous head and lacing,5
Darkness,"L: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a jet black color and a thick consistency. There was an inch of foamy, tan-colored, fairly long-lasting head. Good lacing.",4.27
Darkness,"I think when it comes to the look of a stout, the only real make/break is the quality of the head, and this was certainly nice with a thick beige head that leaves behind a creamy looking layer and some decent lacing. Big fragrant beer here, as raisin, molasses, fig and vanilla dominate the smell. The taste starts out abrasive with a bitter coffee upfront that turns towards dark chocolate and hints of vanilla and fig. Under it all is a touch of alcohol heat that plays into the aftertaste",4.29
Darkness,2010 bottle (Vampire),4.66
Darkness,This beer is amazing. I look forward to October every year to drink this beer. The barrel-aged Darkness is just as good. Let the Darkness flow through you.,4.93
Darkness,"Finally! After all of these years, I finally get to knock this one off of my Want list! ",4.5
Darkness,"This might be my favorite non-barrel aged imperial stout. I usually age all of my imperial stouts at least one year to kill off the hops to get that dark, chocolate-y, coffee-like, malty profile. This beer is a little hoppy, but I actually enjoy it. I haven't found another beer like it, so I'll continue to pay the hefty price (~$20/bomber). Wish they did 4pks!",4.56
3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA,"16 oz. can. Hazy pale orange. Smells of zesty citrus. Lime, tangerine, etc. Tastes of the same citrus peel. A little bit of malt, but it dries out. Boozy back end. Medium body. Big on booze, but not on sweetness. Good, but couldn't drink much.",3.8
3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA,Very cloudy straw appearance with slight white head. Very strong and pleasant grapefruit aroma. Taste is a very smooth prominent grapefruit that exceptionally goid,4.73

3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA,"Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a Tree House snifter; canned 02/06/19 and obtained at the brewery on its release date. Note, my friend got on line at 4:45 am when there were already at least 200 people there (thanks MB!)",4.71

3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA,"16 oz can poured into a tulip. Very opaque. Looks like pulpy orange juice. Aromas of tropical fruit, especially pineapple. Taste is pungent tropical fruit...sweet pineapple and some mango. Delicious. Feel is very full bodied. No sign of the 10% though. Overall, very well done beer for the abv. Super tropical and juicy!",4.66
3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA,2018 release (4th anniversary). Canned about a week ago.,4.25
3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA,"Great murky color, super smooth! I would have bet anything that this wasn't 10%. Complex, danky, citrus, tropical aroma, and flavors that match. There was an enticing sweetness to the aroma and flavor as well. Made it smoother. Among my top IPAs all time!",5
3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA,"murky orange in color, taste is bitter citrus with some sweetness on the backend..this is a bit more dense than most, but that should be expected with a 10% IPA..drinks like a 7 or 8% thou..very smooth scant traces of the 10% ABV..upper echelon Other Half Beer",4.43
3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA,"Canned 2/1/18 (3RD TIME CHARM), Enjoyed 2/6/18, Acquired in a trade.",4.66
3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA,"Fun beer, but the mouthfeel is a little too much, maybe too much lupulin powder. Mind you, this beer was still tremendous. Not a beer you want to drink all the time, but fun to pull out for an anniversary.",4.41
3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA,I really liked this one. It's packed with hops and there's Galaxy in there. It's a 10% very high for an IPA and you can tell as the abv is noticeable. I don't think it was necessary to make it that high so i downgraded because of it.,4.53
3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA,Can shared by jc1762. Thanks Jon!,4.5
3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA,Luckily for me I have friends who go to almost every OH release and are good enough to share. This was exactly what I expected. Another very solid - juicy IPA from OH. Not their best - Like Whoa is - but still very good. The NJ/NY craft beer scene is exploding and OH is one of the best. Well done,4.54
3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA,"Poured into a 16 oz Troegs Snulip canned on 1/27/17. Pours a murky bright yellow, almost looks like orange pinapple juice, with a massive 3 finger sticky white head that leaves thick patches of lace.",4.91
3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA,Hazy orange yellow color after being poured in to a pint glass. Tropical fruit smell with predominantly pineapple. Wonderful taste with nice bitter hop finish but has a balanced alcohol presence. Excellent,4.84
3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA,Probably the BEST Other Half offering I have had from them....and I have had some amazing Other Half Brews! Huge Juicy Hop Bomb!!! Glad I have a 2nd can to save for another sitting :),5
3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA,"This might have been the beer from Other Half that I was most eager to rate, as there was quite a bit of anticipation for this. Without a doubt, this lived up to those expectations as the beer was one of the smoothest and most complex that I ever had from them, easily exceeding the high standards that they've set over the last three years!",4.68
3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA,fresh can drank on 2/16/2017,4.4
3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA,"I think this beer is top notch. My only complaint is i think they could hide the 10% heat a little better. Everything is there for this beer great citrus/floral notes and taste great mouth feel, Just tastes a bit boozy. I almost want to put it into the triple IPA category. If it was it would be the best out there.",4.59
3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA,"Big juicy beer - looks like it and tastes like it - opaque gold, grapefruit-orange-looking body, two fingers of off-white foam that slide down the glass with sheets of lace trailing behind. Pungent aromas of rich citrus and orchard fruit, like orange and grapefruit; flavors follow in kind but with tropical impressions like pineapple added to the mix; moderately bitter and sweet, full-feeling and medium-weight, cushy carbonation and soft - yet another NE-style winner - 10% abv and an barely legible canning date - presumably 1/27/17.",4.5
3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA,"Received in trade. Pours a hazy golden straw yellow with hints of orange. Pulp like look in the glass. After cracking the can open you get citrus and light tropical fruit wafting from the can. The nose post pour is fairly bold and large. The nose is of citrus both grapefruit and orange as well as light tropical fruits, pineapple and a bit of very light pine. While the nose is a bolder citrus I felt like I was picking up the tropical fruits Upon first taste, fresh tropical fruit/pineapple juice led way to a citrus pith/rind. At 10% and triple dry hopped plus the addition of Lupulin powder I still feel like I found a bit of a sweet doughy malt hint altho it was very nuanced and disappeared quickly. The alcohol hides well at colder temps but as the beer warmed the alcohol seemed to become more pronounced and a bit hot. I'm not sure the triple dry hop did much for the beer but I get why they did it. Overall it was a fairly smooth with a medium body and easy to drink for a 10% imperial triple dry hopped brew. Very good.",4.56
3rd Anniversary Imperial IPA,"Look is orange juice. It's hazy and super thick- I love it. Smell is very fruity and juicy. I assume that's citra Hops? Taste is also juicy. It's surprisingly not very bitter for a 10% DIPA. World class. Other Half, you rock!",4.87

Montmorency Vs Balaton,"500 ml bottle into signature tulip glass; Blend 5, bottled in 5/2018. Pours fairly hazy deep reddish orange/amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy pink head with poor retention, that reduces to nothing eventually. Minimal spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge sour/tart/tangy red/black cherries, fruit skin/pits, lemon, lime, peach, plum, pear, apricot, red/green apple, currant, red grape/wine, oak, peppercorn, hay, straw, grass, wheat, cracker, and white bread; with light notes of leathery/musty Brett funk, red wine vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness.

Montmorency Vs Balaton,"L: Poured from a bottle to a snifter glass. Had a bright, cherry red (duh) color and a hazy consistency. There was a quarter inch of foamy / fizzy, off white head that quickly dissipated. Not much lacing. ",4.28
Montmorency Vs Balaton,"L - Nice translucent cherry red appearance, almost no head that lingers",4.36
Montmorency Vs Balaton,"Pours a deep burgundy with a ruby pink foamy head. Head retention is good. Aroma is cherries - big and bold. There is a little lactic tartness, but it's smoothed over by the cherry sweetness. Hints of rye bread and earthy malts and hops round it out. Flavor profile is cherry puree. Woah. Hints of lemon, lime, and yeast smooth and balance it out, but the storyline is cherries. Mouth feel is medium with a fuzzy, velvety texture that makes for playful sips. Overall, big cherries with a tightly controlled saison underneath. Really well done.",4.47

Montmorency Vs Balaton,"Poured a deep red fruit punch color with no head. Aroma is very sweet and juicy with heavy notes of tart cherries. Even picking up the sweet maraschino cherries from the jar. Not much barrel character though. Then at first sip, it starts dry but as it warms up, it immediately showcase the sweet, juicy tart cherries. Very fruity, like sweetened cherry juice added. The sour is is not too harsh, allowing the sweet malt to carry through, making the beer almost drink like candy. There is heavy carbonation that oddly seems to reduce at room temp. Overall, a very approachable sour that doesn’t fall short on the added cherries!",4.5
Montmorency Vs Balaton,Blend 3. Nice cinnamon to the nose - slightly unexpected in a cherry beer. Rich and thicker than most cherry beers - none of the thin cough syrup that I've come to expect from cherry fruit beers and sours. Light barrel notes. Quite good. Really bucks expectations - I like this beer as much because of how it surprises me as how genuinely good it is!,4.5

Fuck I hate coconut, it’s more of a texture thing so the rest isn’t so bad. But that’s definitely all there is on the scent of this one, it covers up any chocolate or coffee that may be lying beneath it cold. The taste is YUUUGE coconut up front which is followed closely by decadent sweet chocolate, light roast coffee, and some lactose. Mouthfeel is decadent, not quite chewy, but nosing right up to it. Overall this is fantastic, they hit the nail on the head and I can appreciate that even if I don’t necessarily like coconut.",4.51

Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped),"
OVERALL: Excellent stuff. The nose on this one is out of this world. It’s a bit harsh for the ABV perhaps, but other than that, there’s lots of juicy goodness here to enjoy. Thanks again for the can, guys! Appreciate you thinking of me.",4.19

Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped),"Beautiful pour of milky orange, medium head and lots of lacing. Nose is grapefruit juice, a bit of resin. Flavor has the hop resin more forward, with herbal notes over a powerful pith core. The finish is surprisingly mild, given the grapefruit emphasis. Tasty and beautiful.",4.5
Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped),I picked up several cans and the beer is almost perfect. The fruit taste and aroma stand out. I loved the beer but the staff at the Canton location were not friendly. A simple thank you would have gone a long way to enhance the experience.,4.91

Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped),"Pours an opaque orange with nearly two fingers of white foam. Head retention is okay. Aroma is orange, papaya, pine, dank, and tangerine, mingling tropical fruit juice with biting Northwest hops. Wheaty, biscuity, toasty malts shine through in the middle. Flavor profile is orange, tangerine, papaya, peach, pine, and light dank. Aside from the abundant hops, wheat and biscuity malts show through. Mouth feel is lightly effervescent with a chalky, grainy texture. It has a medium viscosity. Overall, flavorful and dense, bit less juicy and smooth from other Trillium offerings. ",4.46
Melcher Street (Double Dry-Hopped),"Looks great and smells OK but compared to DDH Fort Point this is kind of a let-down. Bought in Boston and drank fresh. Side-by-side with DDH Fort Point and DDH Stillings Street, this was the worst of the three----but still an overall great Trillium beer!",4.17

A double dry hopped version of Melcher Street this amped up American IPA features a heavy dose of Mosaic hops.

Everett Porter,"Pouring from a 500 ml. bottle into a tulip glass. This beer pours out dark brown and forms black in the glass. It forms one finger worth of dense and creamy caramel colored crown. The smell is roastiness with some hop presence almost bringing a resin element into the mix. The taste brings a creamy note into the roastiness, while still delivering that hop presence. Mouthfeel is creamy. This reminds me a lot of Pappys Porter. Must be something about Vermont.",4.38

No signs of significant oxidation, and the floral hop character is extremely delicate, surrounded by dark chocolate, earthy cold-brew coffee, and oats. Moderately full body and luscious, silky mouthfeel. Perfect degree of carbonation and a light, medium-dry finish.",4.41
Everett Porter,"This is an extremely good beer. Drank it back-to-back with a 2018 Victory at Sea and in no way does this take a back seat. Dark brown, half-finger head with an aggressive pour. Perfect roasty nose. Not coffee, not shoe leather, not chocolate, maybe a combination of all three? Not sure but a very pleasant and unique aroma.",4.63

Everett Porter,"I like Hill Farmstead's offerings, and it is certainly worth a stop at the brewery when I am in the Northeast Kingdom but... I had always considered them just one of the many excellent breweries here in Vermont. This weekend I had Everett, fresh, and my entire opinion of their enterprise changed. This is, quite simply, the best tasting thing that I have ever had... it is perfect in every dimension. The taste starts with chocolate and coffee and a glorious warmth sustains like the tone of a vintage Les Paul through an old tube amp.",5
Everett Porter,"The appearance was a nice looking dark brown color with a one finger white to off white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. Light lacing surrounded the glass, thick yet not too thick as it showed enough spliced delicate thin-ness to it (adequate). The smell started off with sweet to robust and roasty coffee and cocoa moving slowly into a real nice malty aroma. The taste rolled into the sweetness nicely with a fairly sweet to roasty with a tad of bitter coffee blending nicely. There’s a nice semi-sweet to roasty aftertaste bleeding into a semi-dry finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body with a fairly nice sessionability about it. Carbonation runs nicely underneath fulfilling a fairly light quality but not too light. Overall, as an American Porter, it works. Its nice and definitely one to have this time of the year.",4.41

Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point,"Canned on 05/06/19 and picked up at the Fort Point/Seaport brewery. Nose and flavor are inviting and delicious, with lots of those Mosaic qualities. Pine, pungent citrus fruit like mango, and fresh spring grassy goodness. Soooo smooth and creamy in the finish and feel. One of the finest examples of a properly-hopped APA with everything you look for in the style and in a craft beer in general. One of those beers you could drink every day without complaints.",4.65
Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point,"Yeah, this is old as the date on the bottom of the can read 10/4/17 and yes, I have a ton of beer to get through here at my house. With that being said, I wasn't sure why this was rated so high. Maybe it's the name on the label or the nature of the hopping but overall, this was an average beer that didn't stand out in any particular way to me, even if there was hardly any sediment from it being in my basement for all this time...",3.78
Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point,"I've been on and off with mosaic for a few years now - I'm a fan of how soft it makes a beer, and Fort Point is no exception. This beer also exemplifies the mosaic effect - it's quite green and grassy, and while that's great, I am not sure that I get the hype. The beer is quite drinkable and tasty, but it's certainly no Citra-hopping.",3.68

Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point,"Very nice APA. Slightly pinkish in color and very fruity, with melon and passionfruit standing out on the nose and palate. Nice soft texture.

Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point,"Can from the brewery in Fort Point in Boston, MA, whilst in town for EBF.

Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point,"Went to Boston from Alabama with the express goal of getting the New England IPA experience (this is an APA I know). Almost every IPA lived up to their hype; however, I must say this one was riding Trillium's hype train. That said, everything else from Trillium nailed it. ",4.19
Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point,A: Body is a very orange juice colored body. There wasn't much head or lacing in the beginning. Enough carbonation to keep a small head and a light lacing while drinking. Color is good but head/lacing is lacking. ,4.47

Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,"2018 release. Received from @woemad in a BIF box. Poured into a pub glass. It pours a dark walnut with cola hues at the bottom of the glass. The creamy, medium mocha-colored head faded slowly leaving a thin film of lacing inside the glass. It's highly aromatic with roasted malt, oatmeal, bourbon, freshly-brewed coffee, caramel, nuts, cocoa, tobacco, and earthy char. The taste opens with notes of both fresh and burnt coffee, oats, bakers chocolate, burnt nuts, leather, and char. As the glass breathes and warms, I'm noticing more caramel sweetness and just a hint of black cherry on the tip of the tongue. The bourbon is clearly evident but it doesn't overpower the other flavors, which are nicely balanced and nuanced. Despite the burnt notes there is surprisingly little bitterness at the finish. This Stout has a thick, creamy mouth feel with low/moderate carbonation. There is no escaping the 13.6% ABV, which is more than just warming. Sip this one slowly. Savor it because it is one of the best Oatmeal Stouts you'll encounter. Thanks, @woemad for the chance to drink this exquisite Stout.",4.59

Chocolate, maple, vanilla, fudge, roasted malts. Taste is super intense. Lots of roasted malts, burnt wood, coffee grounds, vanilla, and chocolate. A nice bourbon backbone is throughout. The alcohol is definitely prominent - a slight bourbon aftertaste. Mouthfeel is actually a bit thin - not as creamy as expected. Overall, amazing.",4.51

Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,"Well, the rule of thumb seems to be “Anything from Fremont with wax will be excellent.“. It’s always great to experience another stout in the rarified Abyss, Parabola and Wootstout world, and this one makes it there with ease. Beautiful blackest brown with only a tiny light leak at the meniscus. Subtle, rich and arresting aroma full of dark chocolate made a little milky by the oatmeal, french-press coffee with cream and tangy molasses. The taste is almost indescribably wonderful. An imperial coffee stout, yes, but so perfectly blended, so deeply complex, so rich and sweet yet dry in just the right places, it succeeds on every level. The feel can only be described as chewy, wonderfully, wonderfully chewy. It’s so beautifully blended it tastes like it’s had a couple of years in the bottle, but this is on tap at Beerworks in Medford (because they are so awesome). I do have one in the cellar...",4.56

Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,"Pours black and despite pouring straight into the glass at a moderate pace, only a half finger of khaki fizz rose up at max. Head retention is poor. The second pour from the second half of the bottle headed a slightly larger and foamier head, but still not great retention. Aroma is dark, rich coffee right on the nose with rich roasted malts behind. Additional notes of toasted, caramel, and bread malts mingle with toffee, bourbon, and char to form a hearty, dark aroma. The 13% ABV peaks through the aroma letting the drinker know what they're about to consume. Flavor profile lands notes of roasted, toasted, and caramel notes right up front. Coffee, with a decadent chocolate note, and toffee, caramel, bourbon, and a bitter sting of char at the finish round out a deep, dark flavor profile. It hides its 13% ABV well. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a hearty, velvety, smooth texture that is warming and welcoming. Overall, a hearty stout with delightful notes of coffee throughout, exactly as the label would suggest. Great beer. ",4.64

Lou Pepe - Gueuze,"Pours an almost brown color, with a slight head. Smells a bit funky and citric. There is an intense early tart flavor to this, but it mellows out very nicely.

Congress Street IPA,Classic New England IPA looks with that yellow gold color and a massive 2 finger off white head that faded slowly and left really nice spotty lacing. Trillium IPA's keep the looks at the highest standard. ,4.44
Congress Street IPA,"Yeah, my can of this is old - really old (7/21/16) but this is a classic and I vowed to have it, along with everything else in my basement, before it burst or broke. Even though this was quite a bit of a malt bomb when I opened it, it wasn't bad and was still enjoyable to a large extent. Very little sediment was poured out as well, which made the experience that much better!",4.02

Congress Street IPA,Columbus Hop is biting right up front. Not a huge fan of this hop. It’s creamy. Opposite beer for me. Dulled when it warmed up. Showed it’s single hopped “ Sheare’ness “. Very good. Another good one from Trill. Need to try the Dub version of this!,4.29
Congress Street IPA,"I expected a little more for the price they are charging. Solid IPA, nothing more. The price gouging makes a ride to Charlton or VT for true world class beer a lot more appealing",3.77
Congress Street IPA,"Pours a bright, opaque orange with a finger and a half of white foam for head. Head retention is good, as is the lacing left behind. Aroma is orange, papaya, mango, melon, and pineapple layered over biting pale and wheat malt notes. Lovely citrusy aroma luring in the lips for a sip. Flavor profile is smooth and round notes of orange, pineapple, melon, and mango. Tropical fruits are suspended over a base of wheat, pale, and biscuity malt notes. Hops absolutely dominate the flavor profile ratio here. Mouth feel is medium-thick, with a filling, grainy, velvety texture that drives this beers presence from modest to unabashed. Overall, it's pack-a-punch without remorse. It carries a heavy weight, and manages to deliver it unbroken. Big citrus notes, both domestic and tropical, layered over thin, but firm, malts. ",4.5
Congress Street IPA,Appearance: the body is a cross between baby yellow and tan. Totally opaque with haze with a 1-finger white head with good retention.,4.17
Congress Street IPA,Very solid smooth IPA. Contains Australian galaxy hops with peach Clementine fruit and pine. Didn’t think it was amazing compared to other offerings like DDH fort point but solid.,4.28
Congress Street IPA,"Tastes and smells like biting into a citrus fruit on a freshly cut lawn beside a copse of pine trees. Great mouthfeel, very drinkable. Enough bitterness to balance out the juiciness nicely. A stalwart in Trillium’s awesome lineup.",4.53

Heavy Mettle,"Traded for this a while ago, as the date on the bottom of the can read 1/15/17 with ""EW-WAM-AM-AH"" written below that. I don't know what that means or if that is a heavy metal reference but I can honesty say that this was a typical Trillium beer that had all of their attributes present in it, including an easy sense of enjoyment to it throughout my session!",4

Heavy Mettle,Look - classic nehazy and golden color,4.46
Heavy Mettle,"10/15/18 batch, updated rating and review... .my Prior rating was 4.7, this was the first trillium beer I ever had and it opened my eyes to the unique flavors that hops can impart on a beer.",3.08
Heavy Mettle,"Bright orange, sticky head. Smells like sweet orange, mango, pineapple, and dank hops. Tastes are the same as the scent with a great balance of sweetness from the fruit flavors and the bitterness from the hops. Nice creamy mouthfeel and hidden alcohol. Great beer.",4.66
Heavy Mettle,Very cloudy straw color with white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a grapefruit and other citrus without any hoppyness. Taste is a Devine grapefruit that is very smooth and no hops at all.,4.67
Heavy Mettle,"[Original rating 2017-12-26] Draft at Armsby Abbey Worcester MA. Easily one of the best DIPAs I've ever had. I want to just sit and smell it. Pours cloudy dark gold with a medium white head. Aroma of citrus, peach, straw. Taste is tropical fruit, peach, a little bitter in the finish. Great balance. The alcohol is very well hidden, does not seem like 9.3%.",4.46
Heavy Mettle,"Another excellent beer from Trillium, this one pours a thick, hazy yellow and smells softly of stone fruits. To the tongue, the peach and nectarine are most prevalent, but there is a little more of a citrusy taste underlying it. The milky texture and grainy undertones prevent this from being too fruity.",4.44
Heavy Mettle,"Wife Picked-up a four-pack at the Trillium Brewery in Canton for about twenty bucks. Guessing she didn't notice the 9+ ABV. Pretty smooth, considering the ABV, a bit dank, nice brew.",4.25

Heavy Mettle,Canned 11/21/17.,4.23
Heavy Mettle,Just an enormously hopped beer that blows beyond what my finicky palate can handle these days. Carry on and pick up the info you seek from a more hop-headed review.,4.14
Heavy Mettle,Sampling a cold 16 oz can poured into my snifter. The beer pours a hazy orange color with creamy bleached white head of 1 cm foaming up and fading to a sturdy surface layer soon after the pour is complete.,4.28
Heavy Mettle,Golden and hazy with no visible carbonation. Topped with a finger of yellowish head.,4.1
Heavy Mettle,"If I wanted to impress Amanda Kerr, if she said, “Raul, bring me the best haze you got...” I would not hesitate, and I’d go straight for Heavy Mettle. Hella robust tropical fruits on the nose and tongue; but all greeted by that oh-so-familiar dry, pithy aftertaste. Again, the last part is not for Raul, but he defends your right to love it. Cheers.",4.41
Heavy Mettle,Poured to a teku glass.,4.26

Heavy Mettle,"Hazy orange pour with slight head and nice lacing .... smells of passion fruit, pineapple, mango and light orange ... tastes of all the same with little boozy bite at the end.... at 9.3 you’d never know based on taste.... dangerously tasty beer",4.24
Heavy Mettle,Pours a dark orange color. Completely opaque and quite hazy. Thin white head dissipates leaving a thin ring of white foam along the outside of the beer. No lacing. ,4
Heavy Mettle,"This beer pours a cloudy golden orange color reminiscent of honey. There is a two finger, creamy white head with average retention for the style. It leaves some spots and patches of lacing on the glass.",4.55

Double Stack,"16oz can, dated 9/6/19 (I think, the first digit is smudged. Happens when you dat eon the shoulder of the can instead of the bottom) poured into 14oz teku. Poured the expected and typical solid black color, with 1/4 inch of light brown head that had low retention and lacing.",2.65
Double Stack,Appearance: poured pitch black. Appeared slightly thin while pouring and with no presentable head. ,4.3
Double Stack,Poured from a 16 oz. can at home. Thanks for the trade Dan! The taste of this follows the aroma with a nice mixture of maple and coffee. Thick. Very enjoyable.,4.5
Double Stack,16 oz can from Oregon via a friend. Pours a rich thick black with half finger of medium brown head. Aroma on opening can hits with maple syrup evoking a full pancake breakfast - in the glass the aroma remains strongly maple but with definite coffee notes and hints of chocolate.,4.49
Double Stack,"Tasted from can. Pours dark brown with tan head. Lots of maple and coffee on aroma. Taste is sweet with a chewy and sticky mouthfeel. Flavors of maple syrup, molasses, coffee. Awesome breakfast style stout.",4.77
Double Stack,"Every Summer, I make this frustrating mistake of thinking that I’m actually going to spend the entirety of the three four high climate months crushing can after can of refreshing Pale Ales or IPAs. This misconception usually results in me doing something stupid like buying multiple four packs of the same beer thinking that the hot weather will help me power through the beers, and make them feel enjoyable all at the same time, while completely discounting such variables as (1) the fact that the human appetite decreases during warmer seasons; (2) my taste buds seem to get burned out from hops a lot faster in the summer; and, (3) regardless of the season, I’m usually too tired to drink a large quantity of beer after work, so I tend to reach for the higher ABV beers than the lower.",4.43
Double Stack,"Pours really nice with a relatively thick tan head. Smells wonderful, tons of maple followed by roasty coffee. Taste is underwhelming compared to the smell. Neither the maple nor the coffee is as strong as you would expect from the nose, and the base beer is not tasty enough to back them up. Some bitterness comes through, but it's almost burnt-tasting, not sure if that's from the malts or the coffee. Feel is not great. Not really very thick for an 11% stout, and it's a little over-carbed too. Overall, a fairly good beer, but disappointing. I would probably like it a lot more if I hadn't tasted other far-superior coffee/maple stouts like ISLBS and Imperial Falling Colors.",3.96
Double Stack,Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger thick foamy tan/light brown colored head that faded slowly and left very nice foamy lacing that did not slip down back into the glass. ,4.85
Double Stack,"Pours with a dark moderately thick stream and forms an enticing dark khaki head that dissipates quickly but leaves a nice ring of bubbles around the edge. The smell is very pungent and is dominated by maple. Taste follows the nose with tons of maple and hints of coffee, which comes out more as the beer warms. The body delivers about a medium mouthfeel, which might be this beer's weakest point. The carbonation is medium to high and the alcohol is well-hidden.",4.5
Double Stack,"Thanks to Jim S. for this 16 oz. can, a long-time want finally coming off the board. ",3.97
Double Stack,"I had on tap a couple of weeks back, but happened to be in the Portland area during a release. Naturally, I grapped some cans to go. It was good on tap, but couldn't help but think the feel and aroma were weak compared to the hype. Let's see how the can compares, shall we?",4.55
Double Stack,Poured into a tulip glass via can,4.36
Double Stack,On tap at the brewery. ,3.01
Double Stack,"Pours a coffee black. Wow, what an aroma! Maple syrup and vanilla bean and some French press all meld together. Sweetly sippable and dangerously decadent. The coffee gives it a sharp edge that's balanced by the sweet side of things. Fantastic.",4.84
Double Stack,Very maple. Very very maple. Look is very slippery for a stout - light brown trim on a dark pitch brown body. Maple dominates the nose with some light woodiness on the taste. Kind of has a bottler pitch quality to keep it on the family. I was warned about this beer and made some waffles to go with it. Wise choice.,4.39
Double Stack,Appearance - Pours black with a big mocha colored head that settles to a thick cap great retention. Lots of stringy lacing around the glass.,4.71
Double Stack,"From a 32oz crowler, filled 10/25/18. Served in a tulip.",4.02
Double Stack,"this is a beautiful looking brew that is wildly aromatic. reminiscent of a sweet and roasty sunday morning breakfast in very way. creamy flavors throughout invoking buttery maple syrup drenched pancakes, roasty coffee is definitely there but it takes the back seat in a way, blending beautifully though. mouthfeel is perfect.",4.71
Double Stack,"Remember being a kid and having pancakes on the weekend and dousing them in syrup and getting everything sticky? It basically that and it’s wonderful. Not only is this an outstanding beer with amazing balance, it also is nostalgic in what I think of and for that it is unbelievable.",4.7
Double Stack,Like eating maple pancakes for breakfast. Had this at Extreme last year and these guys make top notch stuff. Can’t wait to have more soon. Highly recommended.,4.5
Double Stack,"just full on maple as soon as the can is opened, taste and nose is all maple and the finish is toasty coffee. thin and not very creamy. imperial bean spirit is a better maple coffee stout in my opinion. but still absolutely awesome",4.41
Double Stack,"What a great stout. Looks are pretty standard on the imperial stout front: dark, thick mocha head and lots of lacing. Holy hell is there a ton of maple on the nose. As soon as I opened the can I thought I was smelling the inside of a breakfast restaurant. It’s like a stack of buttered packcakes/waffles with loads of maple syrup poured on top. I honestly can’t stop smelling this, it’s fantastic. Dark chocolate and strong coffee, as well. It reminds me of a Sunday morning. Creamy, too, like coffee and maple ice cream. Taste follows through with maple, especially as it gets warm. Also getting some espresso, Vanilla, bakers chocolate and a balanced sweetness. Feel is a tad thin for an 11% stout, but I can’t knock it too much. Overall, this thing is great. I’d love to trade for more of it. If you like maple and are seeking that adjunct in your beer, I’m not sure it gets any better than this. It’s one of the best beers I’ve had",4.77
Double Stack,Poured from a 16 ounce can. Pours black with just about half a finger of brown head. Smell is huge on the maple syrup. It's strong enough I can smell it while it sits on the table. Very cool. Beer is chocolate on the front end but all syrup on the back. It's a full mouth feel with the syrup lingering for quite some time after. A nice sweet stout.,4.5
Double Stack,Wow factor. True imperial stout with tons of flavor with a chocolate finish.,5

Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,"Pours a cloudy orange. Lots of hops going on - El dorado, Citra, Galaxy, Mosaic and Armarillo. Good combination. Limited bitterness in aftertaste. Good head and mild aftertaste.",4.5
Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,"Pours an opaque orange that turns into a murky burnt-orange when the final ounces are poured from the can into the glass. Head formation is pretty good, netting a finger and a half of white foam. Head has good retention. Aroma is orange peel, tangerine, papaya, lemongrass, and melon-dew. There is a light biscuit malt note, but faint compared with the onslaught of hops. Flavor profile is dripping with hops, without being very soupy or confused. Hops hit notes of orange peel, tangerine, mango, papaya, and lemon zest. Biscuit and bread malts form a firm foundation and actually show throw the dense curtain of hops, making for a well balanced DIPA. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a lightly grainy texture. Overall, a great double-dry hopped NE IPA, showing good balance despite having an absolute onslaught of hop notes from the get-go. Mouth feel is not chalky, which makes it much better than other well-known NE IPA producers' double-dry hopped offerings.",4.68
Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,"01/2017 - One of the better Other Half IPAs I've had to date; combines the big ethanol quality of that I've come to expect from OH with the fruity, zesty, yet still hoppy qualities reminiscent of NEIPAs.",4.43

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,Unknown vintage; drank 10/22/15 on draft @ Fischman's. ,4.25
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,"Had on tap. Poured charcoal black with a finger of brown foam. Smell captures the roast of the coffee beautifully, with dark chocolate, licorice, leather, and char supporting. Taste is not as coffee forward but still very much present, lots of malt with supporting flavors from the nose plus some vanilla and tobacco. Feel is chewy, creamy, heavy, and roasted. An amazing coffee stout",4.58
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,"Small glass from draught @ Zeezicht Breda. I had this before once from draught, which I remember to be superb. This time: Pours a pitch black colour and a beige/light brown head with short retention. Aroma's: sweet, chocolate, boozy. Retronasal: sweetish, cocos, fruity/boozy alcohol. Flavour is moderate sweet, boozy alcohol. Alcohol is rather sharp. Almost full bodied. a bit too alcoholic. Next time will be better again (I hope).",3.67
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,"September 3rd, 2015 - When I leave San Diego, this will probably be the most memorable beer of the many, many beers I had. For one, I had it at one of my first visits to any brewery since moving to San Diego. But it is also an amazing brew. To the eye it looks like a somewhat intense stout, with a brown foam and a thick body, but not too oily. The aroma is big and bold, and cold and saturnine, like the smell of cold metal, but with some cacao nibs on the edge. The flavor is the real appeal here. Creamy, rich but not cloying, it is decadent, and deserving. Huge gushing chocolate notes combine with deluxe and top-shelf coffee notes, like Bird Rock coffee. Better yet, this beer gets spicier as it warms, like a Christmas ale, and reveals shades of nutmeg and cinnamon. Could this be a rare 10 for flavor?!",4.37

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,"Poured 32oz crowler into snifter. Obsidian in color with huge 3 finger foamy mocha head. Slowly fades into a nice cap and thick collar and webbed lacing on my glass. Roasted malts, coffee, cocoa and rich dark chocolate blend with hints of pepper and earthiness. Flavor is bold with the Speedyway stout base, loaded with bitter chocolate, cold pressed coffee, hints of roasted malt and cocoa. Some earthiness from the hops along with hints of pepper and cream.

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,"Received this can as an extra back in the summer. Could have sworn I'd reviewed regular ol Vietnamese Coffee Speedway before, but upon further review I found out it was the incredibly rare draft only 'Brewers Blend' rendition I had back in 2012 and incorrectly reviewed under this regular version. Good memories for that beer thanks to JLindros! Canned on 4/25/18. Review #3500.",4.45

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,"Amazing beer. Pours black with a nice beige cap, and awesome lacing left on the glass, especially for a big stout. Nose is dominated by rich roasted malts and coffee. Taste follows the nose, but imho the dark chocolate flavors dominate the coffee. Body is fairly typical for the style, as is the carbonation. The abv is extremely well hidden for a 12% stout. This is an amazing beer, and my only wish is that I could have it more often.",4.65
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,"2018 vintage, 16 oz can, canned in April of the same year.",4.11
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,Stout brewed with four different coffee styles. Extremely well balanced with coffee finish and extensive aftertaste. Color is pure and taste is fantastic. Had on tap at Other Half as well. Solid coffee taste and good stout.,4.5
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,"Able to score a goblet on tap from a local Italian eatery...very surprised to find it around here. Slowly, finally, these really good breweries are starting distro in this area. Color is a dark brown. No obvious carbonation but a tiny sliver of head. To touch, the temp was cool to room temp. Aroma was very coffee forward, balanced like a breakfast blend smell. First sips were hot from the alcohol, followed by a smooth coffee presence from front to back of tongue. Mouthfeel was full and left a nice coffee, milk chocolate aftertaste. If I could find this bottled, definitely worth cellaring a few to see how the burn subsides and the flavors develop. It seemed a little one-dimensional fresh, so I imagine aging is a must for this one. The straight Speedway stout seemed to have more complexity fresh. Definitely worth a try.",4.03
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,Had it on draft. Very dark brown color with a creamy brown head and great lacing. Rich chocolate cake smell and taste. Dark coffee and cappuccino flavors become more pronounced as it warms. Hint of strawberry. Very rich and silky smooth feel. Great beer!,4.44

Abt 12,"11.2oz bottle best before A 03 02 21 poured into a St. Bernardus goblet at just above fridge temp 10% ABV. The beer pours bright light brown with ruby highlights and khaki head. Some lacing. The head recedes to a thin cap and persists. The aroma is fruity (cherry, red grapes) at first with dark caramelized sugar drifting in behind. The taste is semisweet cherry with cola, dark sugar and rich malt all popping up before a mildly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with above average carbonation and a dry finish. No trace of alcohol in the taste or aroma. Overall, very good. I'm a little surprised with the fruitiness compared to the malt/dark sugar, but it's still very enjoyable. Now I need to buy more and show some restraint to review nearer the BB date.",4.41

Upper Case,On tap in Vermont. I do not remember where. Three Penny? Probably.,4.25
Upper Case,"Very light for it's ABV. Doesn't have the nose of some of Trillium's other IPAs, and is lighter in body than expected for the ABV. The flavor is there, notes of mango and pineapple abound. It might just need a bit more time in the can for the nose to burst free - I will re-visit if that is the case. For now, this is a solid offering with a sneaky light feel for such a big beer. I remember when 9.1% implied Triple!",4.42
Upper Case,"Outstanding beer, and very different. Actually a very similar experience to Big Bird, which I lucked into two years ago as I picked up a flat of Trillium beers in Fort Point on our way to Cape Cod for a bi-annual multi-family trip. I think this one is actually more polished and tasty, fresh, than Big Bird was. But the amazing hop experience is similar. Looks like a muddy pineapple juice, but the aromas and (to a just slightly lesser degree) flavors cover just about every hop-related note I love about hoppy beers. Citrus, pith, berries, mango, musky wine grapes, dank hemp, tropical fruit, wheat biscuit, sugared grapefruit. Absolutely phenomenal. Grassy, but not overly so, which is a nice departure from most NE IPAs. Really nice level of sweetness, as well, and zero green astringency, even fresh, which distances this beer from Big Bird. Feel is a little thin, but that doesn’t take anything away from the amazing, complex, and harmonious nose and tongue. Amazing that you can throw an ungodly amount of different hops together and get such a wonderful end result.",4.39
Upper Case,"Traded for this a while ago, as the date on the bottom of the can read 10/31/16 (yes, I know it's old!) with ""HAPPY HALLOWEEN"" written below it. Sure, this beer was quite filling but the flavors, stickiness, and lack of any massive sediment at the bottom of the liquid led me to believe that this was a quality brew, even down to the last sip!",4.38
Upper Case,"Upper Case pours a thick, murky orange juice yellow with a small, 1-finger ivory white head that leaves little lacing on the glass. The smell has a big tropical fruit aroma with orange, mango and grapefruit with a big bite of danky hop resin. The taste is sweet candied fruit inducing pineapple, mango and good dose of citrus zest with a creamy goodness from the raw wheat. A complex bitterness creeps in finishing rather sticky. Overall, this is a very solid NE style DIPA. Another great beer out of Trillium brewing. Cheers!",4.44
Upper Case,"Draught pour at The Smoke Shop. Nose is mute (opens up a bit once warm) , but the taste explodes with tropical fruit, papaya, guava, passion fruit, mango, kiwi, and some faint citrus. Creamy feel on the tongue and swallow, some ABV burn that drys the palate. Damn delicious brew, just wanted more from the nose.",4.45
Upper Case,Pours an opaque orange gold color with a one finger bone white head that doesn't leave much lacing.,4.35
Upper Case,"One of the best IPA's I've ever had. Went to Trillium over the weekend and tried all the beers on the tap line including Upper Case. Along with Permutation 52 (mentioned in other review), this was my favorite beer of the bunch. All the others were amazing too (including Meddle at a close runner up), but this one had more complex flavors and smell. A great NE IPA style, very juicy, and very smooth for the ABV level. I live in NYC and can say this stacks up very well with some of our favorites from Other Half, Sand City, LIC, etc.",4.85
Upper Case,Wow! Full on blast of overripe mango& pineapple w/ slightly tart resin finish. Extremely slick and thick. Carbonation bursts on my tongue. Outstanding Beer,4.58
Upper Case,"Canned 7/17/18, so a week and a half ago. ",4.55
Upper Case,"Had a freshy can thanks to my friend who graciously gifted me one since I threw a bunch of brews his way for a party. When you open the can, it doesn't just greet you with an aroma, it jumps out and punches you in the face. The flavor is wave upon wave of juicy and dank hoppy goodness. It's hard to describe all the flavors since it's like describing the sound of a volcanic explosion: really fucking loud. I get a ton of tropical fruit with berries and dank resin. Mosaic plays the lead role with Galaxy as an obvious supporting job. Serious body commands this to be sipped and enjoyed, but I never got any booze heat or warmth. Overall this is my favorite Trillium to date with Galaxy Cutting Tiles coming in a close second.",4.66
Upper Case,"Oddly enough, this beer is exactly as they described it. Thick, beautiful orange juice pour, Doughy mouthfeel, and loads of papaya, mango, pineapple, and doughy yeastiness. Very well hidden 9%. Really loved this. Very recommended.",5
Upper Case,"Canned yesterday, the day I picked it up at the brewery, 12/21/17",4.4
Upper Case,"I enjoyed this beer, especially the nose. The nose promised bright floral hop perfection, but after taking it on I expected the taste to be different. It is more earthy than I expected. It is a great dipa, but the taste does not invite the next sip as well as other excellent IPAs I've had from this fine brewer.",4.25
Upper Case,"Tasted from can. Pours a hazy gold with white head. Aroma is tropical fruit with lemon. Taste is moderate to heavily bitter. Flavors of lemon, mango, melon, pineapple, resin, caramel. As almost all of Trilliums beer very well done.",4.53

Upper Case,"Had on tap at the Trillium beer garden on the Greenway. Nice, full aromas and flavors that lean towards the fruity pungency of Galaxy and Mosaic. At 9% ABV and $20/4-pack of 16oz cans, this is Trillium's 'best value' DIPA. ",4.41

This a great example of being in the right place especially since this was the first time I had been to the Hill when they have had cans available. YAY for that.

Society & Solitude #6,"Canned 07/23/19. Enjoyed 08/21/19. Pours a thoroughly hazy light straw colour with fluffy off-white head. Head lasts quite a while and there are significant sheets of lacing during drinking. Aroma isn't huge but has a nice citrus, melon hop aroma along with almost a white grape / wine characteristic of some Brut IPAs I've had recently. Was some Nelson Sauvin used along with the ""almost entirely"" Mosaic? Taste follows the nose with hints of sweet orange juice, melon, pineapple, and again that slight white wine. I say all hints because this is not a huge juice or hop bomb, but rather just a well crafted balanced IPA with many subtle flavours and nothing to blow your socks off or take over the taste. Some grassiness and sweet tartness appear at the end of the sip along with just a hint of non-astringent bitterness to let you taste those hops right to the end. Mouthfeel is smooth and moderately full. This is a very nice IPA, not as big of a taste as I've grown to enjoy, but refreshing & very enjoyable nonetheless.",4.4
Society & Solitude #6,On tap at Armsby abbey ,4.54
Society & Solitude #6,"On tap at The Bench. Pours a hazy yellowish orange with very little head. Lots of lacing. Great nose of berries and fruits. Pure Mosaic hops. The taste is fruity pebbles, pineapple, guava, mango and pineapple. Medium body with a slightly dry mouthfeel and some alcohol heat.",4.27
Society & Solitude #6,"absolutely incredible ipa here, the original style vermont ipa, before everything had to get all messed up. pure mosaic here too, in a way i havent known these hops to be in many years, like they have actually been juiced, insanely fresh, and like a concentrated version of themselves, its outrageous in both aroma and flavor, lemon and tangerine and lemongrass and pineapple notes, but also some tea and flowers and botanicals, like nothing else. a million or more beers feature mosaic hops right now, but none like this. just a bit hazier looking than expected, this is pretty thick and even faintly green hued, nice head on it, but not the brightest or sexiest looking ipa. who cares when it smells and tastes like this through, bursting with everything i love about mosaic hops and nothing i dont. i almost think for a second there is some lactose in this, not because its sweet at all, but because there is an insane degree of creaminess to the soft and expansive texture, like satin on the palate, like i want to dive into it. bitterness is really low here, especially for how intense the hops are, its its juicy all the way through the finish. subtle notes of marshmallow, french melon, and kiwi fruit here too. overall just a splendid ipa, they way these should be, and a leader in a very crowded style. this blew me away. dying to try the other beers in this series now!",4.46
Society & Solitude #6,"Does anyone taste Lipton Ring-O noodle soup at the end? It's more apparent from the can. It tastes really good not so much in spite of that aftertaste, but because of it.",5
Society & Solitude #6,poured into a pint glass via draft,4.49
Society & Solitude #6,"So, the beer pours a rich looking, apricot amber color with pretty decent head retention and light lacing. On the nose, there's a huge aroma of mango, papaya, apricot and pineapple. The mosaic hop presence is pretty pronounced in this bad boy. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, but the tropical fruit flavor wasn't as intense as I was expecting. Mouthfeel was also a bit less full than I was expecting, though I appreciate the fairly light, dry and moderately bitter finish in this beer. The finish is very clean in this beer, and the alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile. So drinkability is pretty good. This is a very good DIPA for sure, though I don't think it quite matches up with the #7 version I tried last night. However, I think a bit more sweetness and richness on the palate would improve this DIPA immensely. ",4.3

I liked this one best when it was first poured and still very cold... absolutely no booze and just the softest most lush fruit smoothie with peach, orange, and mango predominating, there is also like a big almost butterscotch sweetness and some herbaceous and slightly sharp green qualities coming out as it warms. Super interesting and well executed brew!!",4.62

4th Anniversary,"What a banger. If someone told me that this was 10% I would have laughed in their face. One of the best DIPA's I've had in a long time, perfectly executed, and worthy of the hype (which is rare with hazebro IPA's) glad I've got another can.",4.79

Abraxas,"It’s pretty bold to name a beer after this album, but if Carlos drinks stouts I’m sure it’s OK. It looks exactly as I think a big stout should look, ultra dark, opaque brown/black, yet it preserves a beautiful garnet overtone. The aroma is a bit underwhelming although it makes pleasant promises of well balanced coffee and malt. Then the taste brings the game up to world class status, full and complex but subtle and perfectly blended. To make a really great flavored stout of this kind, you have to start with a great base beer. This is exactly what Perennial has done in this case, it is, first and foremost, a really excellent stout. Then the other flavors are blended in with impressive expertise; the chili’s in particular are a delightfully ethereal aura of flavor. Feel is smooth and a little crisp. A very finely crafted stout.",4.36
Abraxas,"Undated bottle into pint glass. Pours a very, very dark brown with a thick dark tan head, which reminds me of the chocolate milk I used to make when I was a kid (heavy on the chocolate powder; you knew it was about right when the spoon would stand up by itself...). Initial impression is dark chocolate, cinnamon, a touch of chili peppers, and maybe some vanilla. Mouthfeel is rich and decadent. Alcohol is extraordinarily well hidden. Finish is slightly bitter but mostly chocolate and cinnamon. This is really tasty. I don't think I could take a constant diet of it, but for a once-in-a-while indulgence, it's outstanding!",4.23

The honey isn't really present here on the nose, but on the palate, it's there in spades at the end and finish, for sure. It's a wonderful mild honey sweetness that lingers for a while. Mild-moderate spicy bitterness, otherwise big but relatively balanced galaxy and caramel malt. This is pretty delicious, and the honeyed finish is really, really very nice. Medium fuller bodied, good carbonation, silky smooth with a slight dry floral and herbal resin that is supplanted by a mild lingering sweet honey.",4.44
Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),"L: super thick, and crazy dark orange with complete haze. The head fades in less than 1 minute. This looks like while fruit purée. ",4.69
Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),From a can dated 4/22/19. Up there with Minot's Ledge as one of their top Galaxy bombs. Does not have a heavy feel to it even at 8.5%. An exceptional beer.,4.65
Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),Canned 8/16/18; drank 8/26/18 @ Harvest Hop Haus. ,4.42
Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),Poured from a 16 oz can into a Willi Becher pint glass.,4.31
Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),Pours like orange juice with a finger of white head.,4.34
Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),L - 1-finger offwhite head atop a glimmering orange juice body.,4.39
Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),Canned on 10/11/18,3.27
Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),"One of the rare reviews I'll do, NOT from stream-of-consciousness, but rather from notes I wrote down. I drank this can in the mountains a few hours ago, in silence, save for the rushing river next to me. An experience.",4.48
Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),Galaxy is not one of my favorite hops - I'll be honest and just throw that out there.,4.6
Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),"This beer is a beautiful expression of galaxy which I’ll admit I’m a galaxy fanboy. This is so tasty and the honey only smoothing out the edges of the pine and sweet resin from the galaxy makes it even better. Perfect execution. The only tweak I would make to make it my number 1 beer ever (beats is infinite by monkish, a DDH All galaxy imperial IPA) would be to double dry hop this beer with more galaxy to bring out that grapefruit and grassy taste to the next level. Phenomenal. Best trilltive ever and it’s not close.",4.78
Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),"Creamy-looking dark OJ color with a thin finger of off-white head. Nice lacing. Huge aroma of weed, earthy smoked herbs and nuts. They carry over the taste, coupled with orange juice, lime, pithy and piney bitterness and a peppery alcohol bite. Some hop bite, too. Full bodied with a prickly feel. There’s a lot of depth and ton of alcohol in this one, but the nutty, smokey quality when fresh isn’t to my preference. I am interested to see how it changes with some age.",4
Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),"08/2016 - While I enjoy the base beer, the Galaxy usage is top notch in my opinion. That said, the honey does a nice job balancing the Galaxy; tasty, refreshing, and super flavorful.",4.46
Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),"Had on tap at the Trillium Garden on the Greenway a month or so back. Super hazy and golden color. Huge flavors of peach, citrus rind, honey, and resin attack the palate. It's very chewy and sticky in the mouth, a bit heavy in the stomach but still so very drinkable due to the flavor. This beer is incredible and the blend of wildflower honey with Galaxy was near perfect.",4.5
Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),Can. White head. Super hazy golden sunset orange. Looks like juice.,4.7
Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),"One of the best IPAs I’ve had. Would put this just below Perm 32 for me. I remember having Mosaic Cutting Tiles last year, and thought it was a mess. The new fermentation for these beers not only makes the hop flavors pop, but also smooths them out and they look great in the glass. Really, this is possibly the best looking IPA I’ve had. It’s looks like a puree of pineapples and oranges, and has a thick, sticky head. The taste is like 32, but a little more bite that I really liked. They’re knocking these beers out of the park lately.",4.71
Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),"Pours a very hazy, cloudy orange body with a two finger white head that reduces to a layer and leaves spotty lacing.",4.58
Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),"Dated 5/18/18 on the bottom of the can, one week since brewing.",4.63
Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),"This beer has the beautiful yellow appearance of egg whites, which might be tacky if it weren't backed up by an excellent smell of citrus and peach and a delectable taste of tangerines and brown sugar. Trillium is on one with this masterpiece, which has a texture that feels thick, bites nicely, and finishes crisp. This is one of the best, and I'm very happy to be moving to Boston next year in large part of the guys at Trillium.",4.57
Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),"I CANsider myself very fortunate to have been the lucky winner of a buncha CANs in a recent lottery on a different social media site. I merely had to pony up the cost of shipping, which was modest, in return for a buncha CANs for The CANQuest (tm)! I had heard of & was certainly aware of Trillium B.C., but I have not been trading in a while & so I did not give them much thought. I am now interested in drinking & reviewing the entire Small Bird Series, especially Pipsqueak Penguin & Stumpy Duck since I have an affinity for the former & a rubber form of the latter who oversees my drinking & will be in an NBS pic later.

Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),[From Notes | Consumed 8/13/17],4.36
Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),"A 1 pint can, canned on 26th July 2017. Poured into a Lost Abbey teku glass.",4.32
Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),"Pours a golden hazy orange with a two finger head, quickly dissipating. Smells of peppery hops, stone, earthy, with citrus. Taste is a bitter bite into tropical fruit, juicy and sharp. Lingering bitterness on the end, little bit of booze burn. Mouthfeel is nice and chewy. Not getting much of the honey. This is likely my favorite of the cutting tiles hop varieties. Good beer.",4.19
Cutting Tiles (Galaxy),"Pours a very hazy orange/gold with thick head and lacing. Smells wonderful, full flowery sweet, fruit, honey, light hops. The taste is amazing, this beer drinks so clean and is so tasty I am blown away. Flavors follow nose with bursting sweetness balanced by hops and floral notes, the combination in this beer is world class, one of my top beers to date. RESPECT.....",4.57
Last Snow,"Pours black with a one inch frothy light brown head that big blotches of lacing. Smells of coconut, roasted coffee and roasted malts. Tastes of toasted coconut, medium roast coffee, roasted malts, caramel, milk chocolate and cinnamon. Medium bodied, soft carbonation creamy mouth feel.",4.42
Last Snow,Presentation: 12 oz. brown bottle with no dates. Served in a Sensorik glass.,4.06
Last Snow,"A porter called “ Last Snow” from a Florida brewery (Funky Buddha) had to be interesting, but I never expected it to be exceptional. Revealing beautiful flashes of ruby and garnet when held up to a backlight, and a bouquet that is redolent of coffee, chocolate and coconut, it’s no surprise that one person declared it to be like a “liquefied Mounds Bar.” And that analogy remains relevant on the palate. A smooth mouthfeel and a sweetish finish produce a wonderfully crafted beer. Some have criticized the sweetness level, but I didn’t find it to be excessive. It’s a truly great dessert beer and one that’s on a par with another favorite of mine called Samoa This. And as it warms, it gets even more flavorful, making it a great choice for any Snow Birds in the Northeast who want to sip it in front of a roaring fire. That said, Last Snow is definitely not a session beer. One and done at one sitting would be my recommendation. But if you’re a fan of those flavors, you’d be wise to keep a sixer on hand...especially if you run out out Mounds bars.",4.77
Last Snow,"Pours a pitch black coloration with a large, creamy, lasting head. Smell is a lovely balance of coconut and roasted malt/coffee notes, with just a hint of cinnamon and earthy spice. Taste is an exceptional balance of sweet, lightly toasted coconut and caramel malt as well as roastes malt and coffee notes, with hints of dark chocolate, cinnamon, earthy spice and just a hint of licorice and vanilla coming through as well. Finishes with a very light bitterness and some sweet coconut and roasted coffee notes lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation. Certainly the best coconut Porter I've had due to the exceptional balance. The coconut is not too overbearing and balanced very nicely by the roasted notes and a good bitterness, as well as some light earthy/spicy notes from the coffe, giving this a perfect balance between sweetness and bitterness. Also has a great, full and rich body and mouthfeel for the style and ABV.",4.45
Last Snow,"L: deep brown/black, tan head, some lacing ",4.15
Last Snow,Pours dark brown with a good finger of brownish head.,4.47
Last Snow,"The aroma is downright intoxicating when it comes to coconut qualities - this really does smell like a liquefied Mounds bar, Coffee, roasted malt, and (of course) dark chocolate all offer a nice ballast to the coconut. One niggle: The additions are so bold, they overpower the porter backbone somewhat. This beer is a total showstopper on the taste buds...well, at least for the first few sips. Apart from a slightly roasted opening, coconut utterly dominates in the best/worst way around the middle and end. Coffee plays second fiddle to the coconut flavors, just like the aroma indicated. Speaking of how it ends, the finish comes across like this coconut coffee porter had three tons of table sugar clumsily added to it - there's that ""so sweet, it's somehow bitter"" sensation I get from a select few dessert beers (like Creme Brulee from Southern Tier...or Maple Bacon Coffee Porter from Funky Buddha themselves!) At the end of the day, the actual flavor of this beer is a total letdown next to the awesome nose. Plus, it feels thin and angular - not a good combination with the extreme levels of sweetness. Said extreme sweetness ultimately chokes the drinkability factor. Carbonation is medium high. I do enjoy this more than their Maple Bacon Coffee Porter, but eh. I don't need to have this again either way.",3.24
Last Snow,Poured into a 16 oz Snulip glass. Pours a very attractive dark brown with a 2 plus finger khaki head that leaves nice thin wisps of lace. ,4.5
Last Snow,"Quite possibly the best Funky Buddha I have had, by far...",4.32
Last Snow,"Whoa! this is expensive for Non Imperial Stout. I forked out 5$ for a single 12 oz. bottle. I'm a fan of Funky Buddha & what they do for the Florida craft beer scene. There is interesting looking chocolate snowman artwork on the label. Wow! I am getting big coconut aroma from this beer. I am not seeing any DATE ON THE BOTTLE. A beer that has coffee & coconut adjuncts needs to have a date on the bottle somewhere. I am ascertaining big coconut, slight coffee. I can't lie to you this is scrumptious. If you like a sweet stout that does not have lactose added to it then this is up your alley although it is costly, but I don't downgrade beer because of their price. Pretty good porter that almost feels like a full bodied roasty stout. This is a sweet stout all the way with slight roasted malts, this is a beer that I would not session due to the sweetness of the coconut & the edginess of the coffee but it's a great one time, one bottle treat for the evening, but it's definitely not something that I would want to session Cheers! A-",4.31
Last Snow,The beer pours a nice creamy brown head that dissipates quickly. The beer itself is a delicious looking dark brown chocolate with a nice texture to it. It looks nice.,4.36
Last Snow,"12oz bottle. Poured out an opaque, jet-black color with a small, light brown head of foam. It smelled of coconut, roasted coffee and caramel. Strong coconut flavor with a mild coffee, chocolate and caramel finish.",4.34
Last Snow,"Smells like coconut. Tastes like coconut up front, then coffee, then a little more coconut on the back end, all with a nice, roasty porter taste underlying it all. Fantastic. Never had a beer with this low an ABV (6.4%) that had such good adjunct flavor. If I lived in Florida, I would drink this all year.",4.35
Last Snow,"What do you have for breakfast in Florida? Well, I'm going with this. Sitting on a balcony looking at the beach I'm pouring this from a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter. This beer pours out beautiful for the style looking like coffee with highlights and not being too dark for a porter. Forms a great dense and creamy tan colored crown. The smell is a bomb of excellent coconut. Fresh coconut mixing with beautiful chocolate. Wow this could be a candle. The taste comes in with strong but good coffee and turns into that great coconut that lingers long after it's gone. The mouthfeel is perfect for the style with good carbonation and not too thick or thin. Perfect. This is an absolutely great porter that I wouldn't change anything about. But I will State one thing before I go! I would STILL choose a Death by Coconut over this!!!! I'm out!!!!",4.83
Last Snow,Another coconut bomb for sure. Not artificial tasting at all and would love to get my hands on more if I have the chance. Hoping they distribute this up here soon.,4.56
Last Snow,"12 oz bottle from Total Wine in Bradenton, FL. ",4.16
Last Snow,Not a big coconut fan so this one was bought purely as a top 250 tick. Expectations of personally liking it are low...,3.98
Last Snow,"Can’t read the bottled on date. Rubs off after 01/... but I’m assuming it’s 2018. Really wish I bought a bomber of this instead of a 12oz bottle. It’s superb. I usually pass on beers with coconut in them but this makes me reconsider. So well done all around. The nose is so inviting, the flavors are incredible, and the body is soooo smooth and creamy. I actually passed by this several times when I was first in Florida and now I honestly question my own judgement. Divine!",4.7
Last Snow,"12oz bottled 1/29/18 (6 months ago) poured into a teku glass at fridge temp 6.4% ABV. The beer pours dense very dark brown with chocolate tan colored head. The head recedes to a thin ring and leaves a little lacing. The aroma is strong with coconut hitting first and coffee trailing behind. The taste is coconut forward as well with dark roasted malt coming in second. The coffee is just barely there in the finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied, adequately carbonated and still mostly dry in the finish. Really a masterful job of not letting the coconut sweetness get cloying. Overall, very good. I was not able to read the bottle date (black ink on brown bottle on dark beer) until the beer was poured. Really wish I could try it fresher as I am a much bigger fan of coffee than coconut.",4.34
Last Snow,"An incredible porter. Worthy of praise. You will not believe this beer is only 6.4% ABV. The beer pours a solid dark brown with medium mouthfeel. The coconut comes through immediately in the smell, and the taste is coconut/coffee with a smooth finish. The next time you're debating whether to go full blast with that imperial stout, have one (or more) of these instead.",4.86
Last Snow,"L: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a dark brown / black color and a thick, opaque consistency. There was a half inch of creamy, tan-colored, fairly long-lasting head. Below average lacing.",4.49
Last Snow,12 ounce bottled on 1/29/2018. Poured into tulip. Excited to rate this longtime want.,4.37
Last Snow,"Came a deep dark cola color with a half finger creamy deep beige head that never really settles.Dark brown sugar,vanilla/caramel,and toasted coconut in the nose,somewhat sweet but it's inviting.A mix of chocolate and coconut hits ya upfront on the palate with a lingering brown sugar and roasted note in the finish.I'am not a fan of coconut at all but this liquid Mounds bar is fantastic,there is so alot more than chocolate and coconut going on here...Very nice.",4.29
Last Snow,"Pours quite dark, nice creamy head. Aroma is predominantly coconut and coffee, with bit of a little yeasty aroma. Flavor follows nose, coconut is tasting a little artificial, but I still like it. Nice coffee flavor mixed in there, slightly dry finish with lingering coffee. Carbonation adds to creamy mouthfeel. Overall this is a fun beer, not too heavy. Looking forward to another 4-pack or two next season.",4.24
Last Snow,"Opaque dark brown color with a thin tan head. Lots of toasted coconut on the nose, rounded out with roasty malt. The taste again featured huge coconut but again it was nicely balanced with chocolate, coffee, and almond notes. Medium-bodied and slightly sweet on the finish. In the era a high abv pastry stouts, this one packs huge flavor into a small package.",4.32
Double Nelson,"Can: Poured a hazy amber color ale with a large white head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of fresh hoppy undertones with some dry hops notes and some fruity hops notes is enjoyable. Taste is a mix of floral undertones with some dry hops notes, some light fruity ester and some light vinous notes. Body is pretty full with good carbonation. Really enjoyable but I actually had more expectation. I wonder if the single version isn’t better.",4
Double Nelson,"12oz canned 9-17-19, opened 10-10-19.",4.18
Double Nelson,"Had on tap. Cloudy dirty gold body with a thick white foam ring. Love the nelson sauvin hop and love what HF has done with them. Grape must, earthy hops, lemon zest, peach, slight grass, black pepper, and mango aromas. Taste has the same flavors but the malt meets them all in a dry cracker way, the combination gives the beer a dry, resinous, and elevated finish. Smell delivers more on the promise of the hops. Feel captures the dry earthiness in a matrix of a neipa, good juicy orange and yellow fruits.",4.4
Double Nelson,"750mL growler from the brewery. Pours a hazy place golden orange with an inch of head. Lots of lacing. Sharp aroma of white grapes, white wine, green apple and weed. Herbal hop notes as well. First sip is white wine, green apple, herbal hops and weed. A bit peppery. Some doughy malts. White wine and grassy, herbal hop finish. Medium body with a slightly dry mouthfeel. Great showcase for Nelson Sauvin hops.",4.39
Double Nelson,"Pours a grainy golden. There's a dank note that you may smell in some parts of the city where youths are skipping class to take part in other, once questionable, but not decriminalized in some states behavior. It smells like week and there is definitely a note of it in flavor too. There's a quiet peppery bitterness on the finish. Overall, it's well-made, just not even my favorite beer involving Nelson from Hill.",4.03
Double Nelson,"Very good NE style IPA, that is, hazy unfiltered IPA which is in fact brewed in NE. It's called Double Nelson so I'll assume they're really trying to focus on the Nelson Sauvin hop. That white wine flavour which accompanies this hop is the primary hop flavour in the profile, and I've been somewhat put off by this in the past, especially with Brut IPAs, but here it is really well done, leading to a very nice flavour, smooth mouthfeel, and pleasant sweet finish to each sip. Hill Farmstead is off the beaten path, not the greatest to get to, & my god, do they take their damn time getting the line up to move through their brewery. I would say Treehouse or the Alchemist can move people through about 3 times as fast with the same number of staff. So, while I have enjoyed the Hill beer I've had, I doubt I'll make it back there again.",4.35
Double Nelson,"Double Nelson pours a murky golden orange color with a small quarter inch, white head, which settles quickly, rimming the glass and some very spotty lacing. The smell is quite dank, with a grassy, earthy weed and pine softened by citrus fruits of orange, pineapple, some white grape with some nice malts and assorted grains resulting in a creamy aroma. Wow! Nothing short of excellent! Lush and creamy over the palette making this very easy drinking. Hints of white wine, grass an herbal notes with grapefruit and pineapple with some pricky spiciness but a soft texture all the way through.",4.6
Double Nelson,Canned 7/29/19,4.38
Double Nelson,Picked up a 6 pack of this at the brewery today.,4.36
Double Nelson,My scores just tell it all. Freekin amazing taste and look and feel good things for my taste buds. If you don’t think this beer is superior it is my humble feeling that you haven’t got a clue about finely crafted IPA’s. New England or otherwise.,4.78
Double Nelson,Been trying to get my hands on this since trying double Citra. Very good brew but personally would still rather double Citra (probably due to my hop preference),4.51

Double Nelson,"Pours an opaque yellow with a finger of white head. Head retention is good. Aroma is tangerine, papaya, mango, oranges and a touch of spicy yeast at the back. Flavor profile is tangerine, mango, papaya, passionfruit and spicy yeast. It opens up lightly sweet and finishes lightly zesty for a dynamically shaped experience. Mouth feel is soft and fuzzy, like a cozy, warm sweater. It has a medium-thick consistency. Overall, sweet and zesty for a flavorful little experience pop. ",4.4
Double Nelson,"12oz. can served in a tulip. Pours a bright, hazy orange with a loose, 1/8th inch, off-white head that quickly dissipates into a frothy slick. Nose suggests cannabis of the can pop. In the glass, aromas of dank, earthy notes, citrus and pith. Taste follows nose earthy/herbal qualities overshadow the citrus. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (cloudier to light) with a carbonation shy of bright and a mild acidity. Overall, an interesting variation on the style - juicy, but not overpoweringly so and not the highlight of this beer.",4.03

Hopslam Ale,2019 version poured from a 12oz can into a pint glass. My sampling occured in January when this was fresh. While there seems to be slight variation of flavor on this beer from year to year I enjoy this greatly each year. Lotsa hops with a touch of sweetness.,4.5
Hopslam Ale,Bell's is bad-ass! What can you say? This is a text book phenomenal 2X IPA. But better than most. An absolute legend in our great brewing state of Michigan. The only thing hurting Hopslam(and most great beers) nowadays is the price gouging! The beer stores here are ruthless and almost criminal if it weren't for the people buying it from them! I seek out the fair-priced honest beer stores and avoid the shysters! Two thumbs up!!,4.85
Hopslam Ale,"An amazing achievement: so rich and full of fruity flavor, without feeling oily and seeet, and despite the high ABV, the alcohol isn’t too present. A real heavyweight, flavorwise. Be careful, though, the ABV will eventually get you.",4.45
Hopslam Ale,"Looks like an amber ale really; just a touch of light haze, fluffy off-white head fades down to a thin film moderately quickly - some pretty decent lacing during drinking. Aroma of sweet caramel malt & piney hops. Not much of anything in the fruit department. Taste follows with a smack of piney hop & full malt backbone. Sip ends with a long lingering boozy taste & feel - pleasant but definitely also letting you know it's packing a 10.2% ABV. I don't taste the honey per se, but there is a hint of sweetness - maybe a tinge of strawberry? - which is barely tasted, but seems to dampen the potential astringency of the hops. Not sure what I expected from this - certainly a classic I've never tried before, from a time before fruity NEIPAs - the better of which I've really come to prefer. I would definitely have this again, it's a great beer, but I'm also fine crossing it off my list & not worrying about seeking it out again.",4.13

Hopslam Ale,"I grabbed a single of this just to see what it's like. It's kind of like an old big boozy Two Hearted Ale. A bit syrupy and sweet, hoppy but not hop forward or dominant, very malty but not in a bad way. It's not bad but I wouldn't seek it out again. nb",3.5

Hopslam Ale,"From Bine and Vine in San Diego - canned Jan 16/19. Pours a nice golden caramel colour with 1 and 1/2 fingers tight off white head. Aroma of caramel malt/honey, then citrus/grapefruit, slightly floral, hoppy pine notes. Taste is at once sweet and hoppy - subtle bitterness builds to a perfect crescendo of grapefruit, orange, pine with honey sweetness in back. Mouthfeel is full, smooth, slightly syrupy - leaves with beautiful balance of bittersweet and just a touch of the 10% booziness.",4.39
Hopslam Ale,"12 oz can, packaged on ""011619.""",4.05
Hopslam Ale,"First one I had was amazing, as youd expect. The second one must have gone south, there was a large rubbing alcohol smell off the beginning and through the rest as I drank it out of a snifter. I only drank 2/3 of it.",4.5
Hopslam Ale,"Can date 1-4-19. Pours a dark gold. I can see through my glass, a hop slam branded tulip glass! Strong citrus smell on the nose. Also get some pine. Get honey, some orange and pine on my first sip. More like a gulp. Quite a bit of lacing on the glass as the head subsided. Silky mouthfeel. Love love this beer every year. Wish they made it year round.",4.5
Hopslam Ale,"PA-POW! This little number meets all of it's lofty hype and reputation. Powerful 10% ABV is fairly well hidden in this hoppy and malty sensation. Have one. Seriously, maybe just one.",4.55
Hopslam Ale,-2019,4.04
Hopslam Ale,"Poured a transparent copper with a finger high head. I must admit, I neglected to read that this is a double brewed with honey, so I wasn't expecting the honey to be worked into the bouquet. It wasn't cloying, and turned out to be quite the harmonious aspect on the palate, balancing out the deep piney bitterness and working well with the citrus rind. Good snag, as always with Bells.",4.15
Hopslam Ale,"Tried this at Eli Cannon's in Middletown, CT. Came in a tulip glass with about a half inch of foamy head. Crystal clear copper color and decent, soapy lacing.

Great beer, would drink again in a heartbeat.",4.43

Hopslam Ale,"I’m an imperial IPA snob....,and I like em with a bit more IBU.....but this one, I’ll make an exception, it’s a great dub IPA!",4.67
Hopslam Ale,"Picked up only one can because of the price, but will definitely get more. Impressive!",4.38
Hopslam Ale,"Looks quite beautiful, with an off-white pinky of foam and generous bubbles rising. A deep amber on this beer, nearly verging on a red ale's color. The head dissipates at a moderate pace, leaving behind bountiful lace. On the nose it's round, sweet, and spicy. Milder than I imagined, but altogether supremely well balanced. A cacophony of flavor from the get-go, with the best texture to a beer I've perhaps ever tasted. Utterly creamy and decadent, with significant grassy and malty notes to go around. Strong taste of weed, much like a Stella has, but with a good wheaty kick at the end. The beer keeps on giving, with something new to taste every sip. Ultimately, I will have to drink this with food. There's simply too much flavor to stand on its own, and I'm getting overstimulated with each taste. If this is your jam, pick up this beer. It's really something, and I'm terrifically impressed by Bell's yet again.",4.14
Saison Bernice,"Much thanks to John for sending me on my way with this in tow. I can't find any date info on the bottle itself, but I want to say he told me it was a 2016?

Saison Bernice,As a New Englander who has been to Vermont several times...I can't help but make the comparison (which I feel is apt) to Hill Farmstead's lovely array of farmhouse ales.,4.39
Saison Bernice,"Poured a bright hazy yellow color with a fragile foamy white head that disappeared quickly. There were extravagant aromas of Brett, white grapes, subtle citrus, with yeasty overtones. Very fruity and aromatic. The flavors are likewise the same, very fruity with yeasty overtones. Plenty of white grapes around the mouth with some Brett and subtle citrus and perhaps pitted fruit. The flavors come without any restraint. Its like opening up this bottle released its potency. The mouthfeel was not harsh, it was quit pleasant, smooth, and light bodied. Overall exceptional beer, the flavors where spot on, again extravagant without being overwhelming. I could drink this again and again if I only I had easy access to this beer.",4.43
Saison Bernice,"Holy crap is this rated high, I had no idea. Well its time then. Pours a cloudy yellow with 1/2"" white head. This review is from a sample on tap at the Bistro barrel aged festival. Dry yeast brett nose to it. Light. When you talk rustic agricultural stuff, here it is, plenty of leather meets wood meets hay meets various barnyard effects here. This is what its all about. Layers of aromas. ",4
Saison Bernice,"Sadly, I neglected to note the batch number - I shared this bottle with friends and bar staff at Barrel Theory in St. Paul. The bottle gushed every so slightly, but showed no signs of being infected. The nose is lightly sour, while the taste is light, mildly sour, yeasty, clean, and very drinkable. It's a beautiful gold-yellow in color with a light, crisp head. I wish I'd drank this by myself - it's a delicious beer!",4.48
Saison Bernice,"Pours a clouded golden yellow with a medium sized sized, spongy head.",3.83
Saison Bernice,"I received this from @bum4ever in an LIF box. Poured from 750 ml bottle into tulip glass. It pours a cloudy, golden-honey color with nearly a finger of foamy, eggshell-colored head and creamy lacing with long retention. The tiny bubbles ascend continuously. It's a lovely pour. It has a fragrant, sour aroma with lemon peel, banana, coriander, clove, and funky yeast. It's absolutely delicious with the sour fruit complimented by a touch of sweet banana and apple as the glass warms. The balance of sour, sweet, and spice is terrific and there is a touch of pepper at the finish. The mouth feel is wonderful: despite the lively carbonation it's remarkably creamy and viscous. Overall, this may be the best Saison I've had the pleasure to drink. The flavors are bold and the feel is as good as it gets. What a privilege to drink this wonderful beer!",4.53
Saison Bernice,Cloudy straw appearance with slight white head and carbination. Fruity aroma. Taste is a dry tart with fruity accent that is not too harsh. A pleasant saison.,4.25

Saison Bernice,"The palatal sensation is quite remarkable. White peppers, thyme, jasmine, himalayan rock salt, cloves, oak, and lots and lots of bretty funky goodness. Some tart peach pith notes surface toward the back as the brew warms up as well, which is quite baffling as no fruit was purportedly harme... I mean used, in brewing this beer. Whatever it is, I could smell this over and over again.",4.84

Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"A spectacular stout; as the previous reviewers explain the taste follows the nose - apples, malty, boozy.",4.45
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,Pours a Pitch black no head or lacing. 4 oz pour. Apple brandy aroma. Very mild roasting. More roasting on taste. Heavy on the brandy. Apple on the end. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.,4.03
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"A beer that lives up to the reputation. I’ll get to the appearance at the end of the review, mostly because the smell and taste are the two most important parts of this beer and for one other reason. Smell is boozy barrel up front with a healthy amount of warm apple to round it out. Taste is more balanced, with the apple slightly leading the way and the boozy oaky barrel subtly surrounding it. Feel is medium bodied, neither oily nor thick-a perfect example of “just right”. Mouth watering, drinks more like a non-barrel aged 9 or 10% abv than a big bold 12. ",4.76

Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"Black pour at 55 degrees with no ruby edges; quick cap of fizzy bubbles. Aroma of apple cider; brandy liqueur retro nasal. Apple jack, red wine, semi sweet malt base; some chocolate; green apples finish. Medium body, moderate carbonation; very light warmth despite 12% ABV. World class, so we’ll balanced and so dangerous; brandy/barrel notes are off-set by gobs of ripe apples from nose to sip through the finish; impressive!",4.71
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"Disappointed. The apple brandy didn't work for me with this dark base stout. It was also pretty thin in mouthfeel especially for this brand. I much prefer Bomb!, Pirate Bomb!, or Birthday Bomb! to this one.",3.68
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"Pours dark black with a small beige head that fades quickly. The aroma has apple brandy, dark chocolate, cocoa, and dark roasted malt. Tastes like it smells. Sweet taste. Not much of th dark roasted malt comes through, so there is no balancing bitterness. Full bodied with moderate carbonation. A very drinkable beer. I love the Apple Brandy barrel. It is a nice change of pace.",4.43
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"In my teku it is a very dark brown with a half-inch, quickly dissipating, tan head.",4.41
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"Prairie Apple Brandy Barrel Noir, 12% ABV. Pours black with the typical Prairie ring of brown bubbles. Nose is apple brandy, taste follows and as it reaches 55 degrees F the chocolate shows up. Excellent mouthfeel, though a touch watery, still overall outstanding. I'd advise just drinking this at room temperature.",4.27
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"For goodness sake, let this warm up to near room temperature. Otherwise, it's a dull, muted brandy barrelled beer. Around 60-65 degrees F, it emerges into a chocolate fondue apple of a stout, still of only modest complexity, but definitely bolder and more appealing.",4.31
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"I had the original by the tulsa boys. I thought and still think it’s the best beer I ever had. This new one is a let down. First smell was that apple juice dominated over everything else. That was odd and off putting compared to the original. First taste was rewarding that it seemed balanced like the original. Then the big let down came into play. The mouth drenching aftertaste of apple juice plagued my mouth. This is not a barreled apple brandy. If it is it is way over powering of the bomb like base that seems balanced at first. The actual brandy alcohol seems even lost to me from the apple domination. Is this a bad beer? No. Is this the best beer I ever had ? No. I even doubt the 12% abv and would rate lower around 10%. I took no measurements though. It’s just not as rich and balanced as the original, plain and simple. Considering this is my favorite beer ever. Please try again. I will applaud the extra effort.",3.12

Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of black cholate, bourbon wood and some tobacco notes is very interesting.

Aroma is big, juicy hop notes, hitting orange, tangerine, papaya, mango, and pineapple. Biscuit and pale malts give it a little base, but overall the aroma is hops, hops, and hops. Flavor profile is orange, papaya, mango, pineapple, and tangerine. Big tropical fruit notes with solid pale and bread malts. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a velvety, lightly grainy texture that really makes this beer drink big. Overall, a heavy experience from this double dry hopped IPA. Tropical fruit notes are heavy and abundant, and yet well refined. ",4.59

O - Solid beer. Top 250 beer that trades for $75? Lol. This is a hype beer and why I think I'm giving up trading, at least for ""limited"" beers. It is a good beer, and I'd be happy to buy it once or twice at cost if I were local. But for California to hype bottle logic to their ""value"" or Florida to hype JWB or AC, or my local brethren here in PA to hype Voodoo to the tradde ""value"" that they soar to makes me just want to laugh. If you're into paying for the name on things then the aforementioned breweries (and MANY more) are what you're looking for. I'm more than over seeking out these super limited beers. I'll drink the few others I have in my cellar and stick to the equally tastey shelf beers.",4.23
Ground State,"This was a gifted bottle from a BIF buddy - and one that I was very, very excited about. I shared this with friends at a local brewery, thus my pour was small, but the beer is undeniably impressive - the nose is full of maple and coffee notes. The beer tastes of light coffee roast, just a bit acidic from the coffee, with plenty of pleasant maple syrup and cacao. It is baffling to me that this is so much harder to get than Fundamental Observation - but as good as it is, it perhaps should not surprise. Who wants to trade away such a fantastic beer?",4.71
Ground State,"This one pours a fairly dark black color, with a small mocha colored head, and not much lacing.",4.8
Ground State,"First beer from Bottle Logic. Pours a thick viscous deep brown/blackish color. Nice mocha head that fades after a minute or so. Glass lacing is there, as it should for a high ABV stout. Smell is sweet bourbon and dark roast coffee. Some vanilla, too, but definitely a bourbon presence. Taste is very bourbon forward, especially before it warms. It’s to the point even after it warms it’s a somewhat hot from the bourbon. I’m not getting much maple, but am getting lots of dark roast coffee. Also dark chocolate, so that aspect of the beer definitely shows. Some more faint vanilla and even a little dark fruit. Got a hint of caramel sweetness, too. Feel is right there with other bourbon beers. Overall, it’s good but I think it needs a year to mature. If I’m not getting much maple now, I don’t expect more to come forward. I’d rather see where this goes after some time in the cellar.",4.27

The smell of this beer is stunning. The coffee and vanilla smacks you in the nose first with the malt, bourbon and a hint of maple filling out the experience.

Still a knockout Stout. Massively sweet malt in the nose and some unique coffee aromas. The incredible malt bill and maple syrup really stand out in the flavor. You get the coffee and dark chocolate throughout in the background. A bit boozy and certainly on the sweet side with a properly heavy body/feel. Wish I saved this for eggs & bacon on a weekend morning!",4.58

Impermanence,"this is absurdly good, my favorite, i think hands down, of the three dark tree house rarities that my legendary brother procured and saved to share with me. i am a sucker for maple syrup, but the maple isnt what sets this apart, the quality and complexity of the base beer is. additives aside, this is a stunning and unique stout, propped up and accented just right by the lactose, which is so rarely the case, and with cool layering of the malts, roasty sure, but with deep cocoa and java and mocha notes in the grain too, which i think is why the cocoa and coffee that are added work so well. its not one flavor climax, its a series of increasingly powerful flavor climaxes through the whole drink. i get the coffee well ahead of the chocolate, and agree with the melted coffee ice cream descriptor they use, some bitterness absolutely, but a deep espresso crema richness as well, very multidimensional, and its with the grain, not above or against it. the chocolate aspect is a dark chocolate, and its there through the whole drink, rich as well, but also that organic dark high cacao bar chocolate with all the complexity and earthiness. the maple is exquisite in here, peaks in and out at different times, adds some velvety textural smoothness, and a continues mellow sweetness, as well as the essence of the maple tree itself, the flavor of the syrup comes through so well, its stunning really. a bigger feel but from the grain not the sweetness or the booze, which i love, and a long chocolate and maple linger. brilliant liquid, famous for a reason, and a treat to share with my brother around the campfire. maybe my favorite tree house beer i have ever had, and a beer of the year candidate for me this year for sure!",4.71

Taste consistent with nose; however, there's a charred quality that cuts the backbone and keeps the brew from being cloying. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a kiss of oiliness to the texture and a mild, even carbonation. Overall, quite delicious and drinkable.",4.27
Impermanence,Serving: Bottle,4.54
Impermanence,A- Motor oil black pour from the 500ml bottle to a small becher glass. The head is a deep cocoa tan hue and it shoots up to an inch with decent retention. A medium ring left at the edges leaves spotty lacing.,4.43
Impermanence,"Pouring thick black ribbons, it builds a tall, dense mocha head that slowly settles to a creamy blanket leaving camouflage lacing.",4.23
Impermanence,"Bottle: this one pours an inky, opaque dark brown color. There was a little bit of a dark tan head that dropped away quickly and left no lacing. Good nose. Mainly dark, bitter chocolate. Some roastiness and a hint of coffee. Maybe some maple. The taste is very good. Bitter dark chocolate, maple, faint coffee. A bit of lactose too. A creamy texture. A really excellent beer!",4.68

Impermanence,16oz. capped bottle into Night Shift stemware. ,4.5
Impermanence,"This is what I dream of when the words “breakfast stout” are raised. The look is pretty but the pour is low head, and there’s not much lacing, either. That said, the nose offers a chocolate milk and maple one two. The flavor, of anything, is more decadent, the sweetness rounding with dark chocolate tartness, coffee acidity and a general brightness I’ve never seen. This is a truly exceptional beer, and not one to miss.",4.8

Impermanence,500ml undated bottle. ,4.49
Impermanence,"Many beers taste interesting at the first sip. But when that first special sip flavor carries through to the end of the glass, you know you have a winner. This stout is blended and balanced so well--coffee, chocolate, maple syrup, caramel all play off each other--a perfect symphony!",4.95
Impermanence,"The best TH stout that they make on a semi-regular basis. TH made famous for their IPAs but they make the most fantastic dark beers in the world, and this is their best! Super smooth but with a ton of complex flavors.",5
Impermanence,"Pours opaque, jet black in color with 1/2 inch head. Taste is black coffee, cream, and sweet maple. Heavy bodied, sweet, with moderate backbone. Complex, loads of maple flavor, especially at the end. Great stout. One of the better maple coffee stouts I have had. Delicious.",4.72
Impermanence,From a 500ml bottle... is there a date on here? I can’t find one. Served in a tulip.,4.39
Impermanence,"Probably one of my top choices in stouts from treehouse. Looks perfect in the glass; pitch black with a thick, milk chocolate head. Great lacing. Smell is maple and chocolate, some coffee there too. Taste blew me away, excellent balance of chocolate and maple, a true desert. Every time it is offered, I make sure to make the drive and grab my allotment. I prefer this over moment of clarity.",4.4
Impermanence,Pours a very deep black color with a thin brown head on top. Nice chocolate notes on the nose along with some dark roast. The taste has a good balance of dark chocolate and some subtle sweetness. The feel is silky smooth. Overall it’s a very good stout.,4.36
Impermanence,"Impermanence pours a thick and viscous dark brown with a small, tight and frothy head that dissipates quickly leaving a khaki tan ring around the glass. The smell is wonderfully smooth lactose sweetness with fresh vanilla beans and roasted coffee. A hint of coconut, maple syrup and smoked wood. Taste.Wow! It's amazingly smooth on the palette with the roasted malts coming forward, as the coffee bitterness is very mild. A nice sweetness throughout with the maple and sweet chocolate coming through.",4.65
Impermanence,A: opaque; very dark brown in color; 2 finger dark brown head that receded to a wispy cap; nice lacing;,4.22
Impermanence,"Pours dark brown with tan head. Good retention. Getting some raspberry sauce like kind you get with chocolate cake on the nose. Maybe it's a combination of the chocolate and the booze? There's coffee, chocolate, it's very fudgey, a touch of maple. It's not overwhelmingly sweet like I found Good Morning to be at times. It's got a ton of flavor but enough nuance to make this not just another adjunct bludger (yes, a Harry Potter reference).",4.34
Stickee Monkee,Served in a tulip glass from a vintage 2017 bottle. ,4.69
Stickee Monkee,Pours out dark brown. Some light penetration. Not completely opaque. Half a finger of head that fades quickly.,4.46
Stickee Monkee,"From tap to tulip, brown-black pour with a cream head that fades fast. Aroma and taste of toffee, raisin, molasses, maybe licorice or anise, malt, caramel. Alcohol is conspicuous, isn't masked by the other flavors in the same way as other beers in this style. Low carbonation, almost a root-beer texture. Overall really nice beer to end my weekend, I was very happy to find this on tap locally.",4.5

I will post this in the cellar review thread too.",4.62

Stickee Monkee,2016 vintage.,4.84
Stickee Monkee,"This is the 2018 vintage, for clarification. I expected this one to be significantly different from Sucaba and Parabola, but it is almost as similar to those two as they are to one another. It's also quite delicious. The price point is a bit heavy though.",4.59
Stickee Monkee,"
This is a big, complex, delicious beer. It is not super belgiany-y in my mind, but it is by no means bad. It does suffer in the look and feel department from this though. It has neither the voluminous head nor the Dumbo-holding-his-feather feel of some Belgian examples and it tiptoes on the edge of cloying. What it does do, though, is balance tons of dark fruit, spice, non-dark fruit, bread, barrel and bourbon flavors. To make a monster supper with a rich tapestry of caramelized sweetness. A hint of warming alcohol makes this one perfect for the colder months. (4.25)",4.27

Excellent Quadrupel. I am drinking this in Redding, Feb 9th, 2019.",4.38
Stickee Monkee,"Bottle: Poured a dark burgundy color ale with a light brown foamy head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of candi sugar is pretty intense with some barrel-aging notes also clearly identifiable. Taste is a mix of deep rich residual candi sugar notes with light candy-like notes, some vanilla and bourbon notes with light dry fruit notes also perceptible. Body is about average with good carbonation. Enjoyable beer but slightly too sweet which limits drinkability after a while.",3.75

Stickee Monkee,Medium head. Pours brown and lush. Tastes like molasses sassafras and by gum it sorghum. Nah for reals though it's a wine-barrel-aged type treat. ALBEIT more of a barleywine than quad. Yum,4.63

Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),"2019 bottle. Minimal foam head upon aggressive pour, with color being deep deep dark brown, with caramel color foam that disappears quickly. Aroma is of rich bourbon barrel sweetness, which also is beautifully present in the flavor. The barrel presence and sweetness shines without coming across too boozy. Still somehow very smooth and balanced. The mouthfeel is perfect, especially as it warms, and thicker than 2018 Damon . This beer should be served and consumed around 10-12 degrees C. ",4.68

Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),"A: served draft at the brewery into a long stem tulip glass, intensely dark with a massive tan head that lingered leaving great lacing, clear, side note: this beer was from a separate tap served warmer than others",5
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),Bottle. Poured inky black. Minimal head. I (as I believe most) love and have loved this label for years. Finally got around to trying it. Honestly I thought it was lacking in barrel character. The other flavors and aromas were tasty but I think it needed more barrel. Still good. I actually believe I had the Port version a few years ago and remember liking that one more than this.,4.03
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),"Luxurious, oaken, bourbon-y, smooth, warm, silky, sweet and slightly bitter. What a gem of a barrel aged beer.",4.41
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),"Aromas of caramel, toffee and chocolate. The taste of milk chocolate with a hint of roast hits your tongue and lingers to the finish. The mouthfeel is fluffy. Overall terrific unpastried BA stout.",4.71
Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),"A black, beautiful beer with a tan head. Dark fruit, bourbon, char and vanilla are the dominant smell. Just the most wonderful stout you could want, big barrel character with the dark fruits and vanilla to round it out. If I could knock it a little, it would be mouthfeel. It could be a touch chewier, but overall this is a delicious beer. Cheers!",4.85

Double Barrel Jesus,"I tried this alongside my previous favorite beer - the Evil Twin Aún Más A Jesús. This was clearly better. Unfortunately, I tasted close to 20 other top rated beers that day, and I didn't take any notes for a thorough review. But I know my scoring is accurate, as this and the Aún Más A Jesús were the first two beers I tasted that night. To me, this is the best of the best.",5

Double Barrel Jesus,"2016 vintage poured from a 22 oz bomber moderately, resulting in a three-quarter inch tan head over a very dark brown body with some lacing. Wonderful nose of chocolate foremost with a bit of booze from the bourbon barrels as well. Taste mirrors nose with a chocolate flavor that won't quit. Not too boozy at all, but the bourbon is definitely there. Very nice mouthfeel, and overall, what a treat. Cheers!",4.59
Double Barrel Jesus,"Black color with a ring of brown foam. Aroma has lots of roasted malt, some umami and boozy bourbon. Taste is roasty, savory, chocolatey with some dark fruits on the finish. Full bodied with soft carbonation. Quite nice but not as spectacular as expected.",4.45
Double Barrel Jesus,"22oz bottle thanks to Steve. First of the Jesus lineup. Normal inky black pour, small ring of head. Sweet, malty boozy aroma, molasses and wood. Taste is smooth, sweet and malty. Vanilla,brown sugar, bourbon. Syrupy and slick",4.03
Double Barrel Jesus,"Tasted from bottle. Pours jet black with dark brown head. Huge chocolate aroma with molasses and some bourbon notes. Sticky thick chewy mouthfeel. Flavors of cocoa, caramel, molasses, toffee, bourbon, vanilla. Bourbon flavor is more subtle that a lot of BA beers. Very well done. Excellent sipper.",4.77
Double Barrel Jesus,"2017 vintage drank on 14 May 17, bottled in February i believe. was delicious, cocoa, vanilla, slightly smokey, sweet bourbon, and oak. the base stout is great but this exceeded expectations. i have another one aging, can't wait to try it after the year mark.",4.96

Double Barrel Jesus,"super super sweet, more sweet decadent barrel notes (big vanilla, toffee, caramel, chocolate) come through than actually bourbon character. molasses and some mellow dark fruits and spice note, hint of oak and mellow bourbon. not much boozyness at all for the abv. medium-full mouthfeel, some chewy texture.",4.58
Double Barrel Jesus,"2017 bottling (I think), poured into Kane chalice and let warm for an hour",4.41
Double Barrel Jesus,Amazing! Huge chocolate flavor and a huge mouth feel that melds bourbon and oaky vanilla with the chocolate for a heavenly experience. Mod-palate I also get an interesting tobacco flavor. Complex. I love this one and it falls in with the maybe 5-10 beers I give a perfect rating.,5
Double Barrel Jesus,Shared the 2017 version of this beauty with a couple friends last night and it was great! Had it alongside both the Maple Syrup barrel Evil Twin releases from this year and the Double Barrel Jesus was better than either of them! Nice boozy finish which will calm a bit as it ages I hope (since I have a 2015 DBJ in the cellar) but has a ton of chocolate and bourbon on the nose and palate.,4.9
Double Barrel Jesus,"Pours black with small tan head. Slight bourbon notes on the nose. Good thick stout with slight barrel sweetness and very smooth finish. Was expecting a little more given the ratings, but still a good beer overall.",4.27
Double Barrel Jesus,"Pours thick and black with a touch of light brown head. Complex nose.....fudge, whisky, leather, raisin, plum, roast, oak, and bourbon. Taste is very balanced.....I think the extra time in the barrels really cuts some of the sweetness that is typical in many evil twin offerings. Feel is thick and velvety with low carbonation. By far my favorite ET stout to date.....",4.6
Double Barrel Jesus,Was cold out of the fridge. Let warm up to ~50 degrees prior to drinking.,4.43
Double Barrel Jesus,"Poured into a Teku glass. Pours midnight black and as viscous as motor oil. Minuscule dark tan head. Dark fudge and whiskey feature primarily on the nose, with some vanilla, oak, and a touch of caramel also there. Taste follows, in a sense- heavy chocolate fudge with a huge, but not overpowering, amount of whiskey. Mouthfeel is pretty thick, full bodied, with a lower carb appropriate to style. Better than the non-BA Even More Jesus IMO. An huge beer, and a good one.",4.59
Double Barrel Jesus,"Poured into a snifter. Viscous and opaque on the pour. Midnight in the glass. Minimal head with wisps of tan foam. Whiskey, vanilla, oak, cocoa, and roasted coffee on the nose. Not boozy-smelling. Tasted like rich fudge dipped in bourbon. The flavors played very well together. The whiskey predominated, and there was a tinge of sour on the finish, but overall it was balanced. Full-bodied but not overly sweet. Better than the non BA version.",4.3
Double Barrel Jesus,"Pours black. Nice brown head. Two fingers. Fades slowly with light lacing. Aroma is awesome. Deep dark chocolate, molasses, coffee grinds and brown sugar. Taste is great too. Follows the nose. Deep chocolate fudge, coffee grinds and dark fruits. Another awesome stout from evil twin. Huge fan of their stouts.",4.68
Double Barrel Jesus,"22oz bottle. Pours a viscous black color with a half inch of dark brown head. Some lacing. The aroma is a big whiff of Bourbon with fudge, molasses, coffee and earth. The taste is a large amount of woody Bourbon followed by fudge, chocolate syrup, leather, molasses, dark fruits and earth. Leathery, Bourbon finish with some more fudge. Heavy mouthfeel with low carbonation. Lots of alcohol heat. It's like drinking Bourbon soaked chocolate syrup. Overall, an outstanding BA Imperial Stout absolutely worth seeking out.",4.39
Double Barrel Jesus,"Striking the difference between robust, decadent and drinkable lands the double barrel aged version of Evil Twin's imperial stout in no one's land, but also everyone's land.",4.7
Double Barrel Jesus,"Poured from a bomber into a tulip. The true motor-oil black pour. Thick and black as can be. The nose is pure chocolate fudge - in fact, it smells identical to a chocolate ganache I made last week. The palate and mouthfeel are what really propel this beer to greatness. Chocolate ganache blends perfectly with appropriately subtle barrel aging, and darker fruits start to emerge only as the beer warms. In terms of mouthfeel, this is perhaps the thickest beer I've tasted. It's an incredible tour-de-force of the style, and one that does the chocolate side of Imp Stouts in an appreciably fresh way. Excellent.",4.47
Double Barrel Jesus,This is my personal white whale. I've been trying to get my hands on this beer for years. Even More Jesus is my favorite stout and I've been dying to try the BA version.,4.7
Double Barrel Jesus,"Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger brown foamy head that was packed with tiny bubbles, dissipating around average time but on the faster side for an imperial stout. It settles into a layer on top and leaves minimal spotty lacing.",4.84
Double Barrel Jesus,Wowza. This was fantastic. New batch. ,5
Bad Boy,"On-tap at Chupacabra in Mesa, AZ:",4.29
Bad Boy,"this is a beer i have been hearing about and reading about for what seems like forever, so it was awesome to finally get to try it, one of those beers of lore, always wondered how much better than everything else can something like this really be, and the answer is that it probably was considerably better than whatever anyone else was doing with this style when it was first introduced more than a decade ago. now, it kind of just seems like another one. thats not a knock against it of course, it was clearly a pioneering beer and more of a trend setter than these guys probably could have imagined, less clear than what was popular at the time, but certainly not hazy for the sake of it, although this could be credited at least partially with making room for such things. i love the hop complexion, i get the columbus way ahead of the galaxy, its so hoppy that i can almost taste the pellets, the greenness, the vegetal element not just the compounds we desire in the beer. its juicy and its kind of sweet from the pale barley malt too, but there is a lot of orange juice, grapefruit zest, and pine needle character here, very northwestern to me, slick and oily feeling and dense as can be, almost woody like lumber, and with a lot of body too, its a big one for sure, perfectly appropriately named. the bitterness is all after the swallow which is cool, its a long trajectory of flavors. citrus abounds as well later on, a honey taste and richness in the middle, and very good, although possibly not as well refined and distinctive as i thought it would be after all the hype over the years. i think, like pliny or something, that the rest of the field has caught up enough where this isnt as mindblowingly unique as it probably once was, but that does not diminish its excellence...",4.27
Bad Boy,"Shared from a growler with Ryan. Pours a pretty hazy orange body. Fresh hops and piney resinous aromas, zesty citrus. On the tongue is delicate but flavorful west coast style zesty hops, piney and citrusy with a light bitterness on the finish. Moderate malt backbone. Smooth and easy, especially for 9%",4.25
Bad Boy,"Parking lot share with George...pours a cloudy golden orange color. Nice and hazy! Aroma of pine, subtle citrus are abundant. Taste is citrus up front with mid sip malt and finishes piney.

Bad Boy,"Dark ipa almost, dark orange and tan notes create an impressive head that holds its own for a few minutes. Aroma seemed to be somewhere along the lines of citra, summit, amarillo and simcoe. ",4.49
Bad Boy,"From a growler. Fresh fresh fresh! Hop aromas are pretty floral and fruit-forward. Plenty of biscuity grain detectable. Flavor is juicy citrus and melon fruits and some dank rosewater. Grassy on the back end, seems like a hallmark of Alpine. Mouthfeel is smooth with a distinctive tongue tickle. Way too drinkable for how strong it is. Right up there next to Enjoy By and Dinner.",4.87
Bad Boy,"On draft at the Alpine Pub. My first time having Bad Boy and it may be the best beer I've had from Alpine. Incredible aroma and wonderful hop flavor, but without overwhelming bitterness. Incredibly drinkable at 9%.",4.49
Bad Boy,"32 oz. growler. Slightly hazy. Small white head. Thin collar. Smell is bright citrus. Boozy. Fruity and a little bit of apple. Taste is bright citrus. Pine. Astringent maltiness. Maris otter is distinct. Boozy. Low carbonation. Medium body. Very tasty, but very big.",4.07

Bad Boy,"A fantastic big hoppy IPA that is surprisingly easy to drink. Feels like a bigger version of Hoppy Birthday, this beer was a wonderful treat to share among friends.",4.75
Bad Boy,This beer is served on tap/draught. It has a golden yellow/gold pour with a small white head. Aromas consist of a floral citrus/grapefruit blend. This taste begins as it smells with a piney and bitter aftertaste. A hint of orange can also be tasted. Overall smooth and balanced,4.43
Bad Boy,Appearance- Received with almost a finger's worth of head which disappears as I write this. The head is pure cotton white while the body is a pale to medium amber which appears as a golden straw when held up to the light. Light lacing as with Alpine's other beers. ,4.29

Thanks Ray for sharing.",4.41

Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"Tasted from bottle. Tasted head to head with Westy 12. Pours a dark brown with off white head identical to Westy 12. Aroma is not near as strong but similar. Notes of dark fruits, caramel, maple syrup, toffee. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than Westy 12 but still chewy and sticky. Flavors of brown sugar, maple syrup, figs, plums, raisins, caramel, toffee. Overall excellent for being the little brother to 12.",4.24

Crusher,"West Coast meets New England. Strong, but not boozy. Very bitter, but with a hearty backbone. Goes down much easier than expected. Tbh, I think I might like this better than Heady.",5
Crusher,This one is probably worthy of a full review... First great label - Fairly simple but the green and yellow really pop... Color is a slightly hazy mango-ish pale orange... Whipped white head with stellar retention... A bit of lacing clings to the glass... The aroma is everything you would expect - a wide array of tropical fruit and light pine... I could keep my nose hovered over the glass all day... Robust flavor with depth and exceptional mouthfeel... Big flavor but subtle mouthfeel... As expected a word class beer and exceptional IPA... Cheers...,4.66
Crusher,"Really vibrant hop bomb, feels much closer to a west coast ipa than NEIPA, incredibly drinkable, lives up to the name. Great beer. Citrus, white grape, sweet malt, earthy, dank, nice hop bitterness. Crusher.",4.45

Crusher,"The Alchemist's Crusher is what craft beer should be all about -- seizing the opportunity to create something memorable, rather than adhering to comfortable standards. Poured from a 16 oz. can to a typical pint glass, Crusher took on a dark pineapple appearance. The smell was incredibly balanced and inviting. The taste, however, highlighted the experience. The piney/dank flavor (some hints of fresh scallion) was complimented by muted, citrusy notes. I'm a big fan of Six Point's Resin, but Crusher steps the style up a level.",4.27
Crusher,"Hazy apricot color with sudsy white head. Great retention and lacing. Aroma is just straight fresh hoppiness. Bitter everywhere; up front, in the middle, at the end. Some light waves of peach, pine, and mango, but bitterness dominates. Dry and crisp. Good carbonation. This beer is all about fresh hops. Usually not a fan of overwhelming bitterness, but this is a great beer.",4.2
Crusher,"Tarnished orange in color with a murky, hazy appearance. Poured with a tall, creamy white foam with very good retention. Herbal, earthy, dank hop aromas with a hint of over-ripe orange. Medium malty aroma. Medium bodied with medium light carbonation. Pleasant, creamy smooth feel with light richness followed by boozy warmth through the finish. Herbal, dank hop flavors with a solid malty backbone. Medium high, spicy hop bitterness through the middle that taper to pinr hop flavors and boozy heat. Finished with lingering pine hop bitterness and light, prickly boozy notes. Dank and bitter with a enough malt to balance the hop character and a pleasant booziness. ",4.26

Crusher,"DATE: September 23, 2018... OCCASION: sampling another of Jeff's Vermont pickups--FYI, this one is the 8% ABV... GLASSWARE: Duvel tulip... pours quite a bright, hazy lemon-yellow body alive with flecks of sediment and tiny, busy bubbles... its head is nearly four fingers of sudsy, soapy, cavernous white that caves in on itself while clinging to the glass--almost too attractive to disturb with a sip... prolonging that, first sniff is thick with juicy resin, lemon citrus, pineapple, mango, and papaya--despite the label, Crusher doesn't suggest any semblance of malt in its aroma... though I would have loved to experience this at 9.6%ABV, the 8% in my glass is plenty rousing, bitter, and Pavlovian in its mouth-watering trigger.... so much so, that the aftertaste lingers almost into its next sip, despite its dry finish.... medium-bodied but a live mouthful... the resin slays the tastebuds, massive and resounding with lemon, grapefruit and mango elbowing everything else out of the profile... light like a Belgian, sneaky with its ABV, great as a dessertif or a nightcap... one of the best one-dimensional offerings I have had, singular in its mission and massive in its effect....",4.36

Crusher,"16oz can: This one pours a hazy golden color. There was a white head that leaves some lacing. Nice nose of lots of hops. Citrus, tropical fruits and pine. Possibly a touch of breadiness too.

Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,"Eyecatching body, like apricot jam, or a fuzzy peach candy. Opaque. Fizzes like champagne, and build light, short, egg-white head, but it's short-lived, leaving a rim within the minute.",4.35
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,"Strong head production, with over two fingers of fluffy, gorgeous snow white head from a moderate pour. Retention is good, leaving no lacing behind. Almost a milky haze to the burnished gold body, light straw color in the sun. Some liveliness as well, but it's not a sparkling body.",4.51
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,"Just wow. I’m guess this is what a Belgian Gueuze should be. Rich golden hues, frothy foamy head, slightly hazy. Smell is funky bret on the forefront with some wood barrel and hints of tart green apple. Taste is where this beer steps up-it’s sour and tart at the same time, but gently so. There’s oakiness, but nothing overly boozy. It’s really flavorful, but subtly so. Feel is also outstanding-crisp, clean, refreshing, dry, almost sparkling wine like. Just an amazing beer. I guess I’ve never rated this style before. Going to have to find more examples, because if they’re like this, I’m going to love them.",4.75

Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,A: Pours a pale amber/golden color with a slightly off white soapy head. Lacing is pretty good considering the ABV and the retention keeps on after quickly losing 3/4 of the head.,4.54
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,Poor almost golden orange with a little head. Bubbly more than frothy head. Sour nose which lend well to the mouth. Almost champagne like body yet thicker feel on the tongue. The taste is intense with funky earthy tartness. Slightly acid aftertaste. Amazing geuze of the highest calibre.,4.84

Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,"Pours a rich gold, champagne carbonation but the little head that is there fades instantly. Aroma of wet oak, funky yeast, vinegar and overripe apple - a bit heavy on the lactic spectrum. Palate begins with tart lemon, a fair bit of sugary malt (for a gueuze, anyway), a smoother lactic dose of sourness, cider wort. I more of a tart (brett) fan over sour (lacto), this is more the later. Mouthfeel is oily and heavy for the style. Good, but a bit too vinegary & weighty for what I personally look for in a gueuze",3.85
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,Bottled 18 months ago.,4.42
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,"This one pours golden with strong carbonation with a white frothy head, reminiscent of champagne. The nose is acidic with sweettarts, apples and hay. There is also a light funk in the nose. The taste is dry and tart with hints of apple, lemon and hay. The backend is clean and refreshing making this one easy to drink. The mouthfeel is overall light but with the right amount of carbonation that supports the flavor profile. Overall, a very nice gueuze that is more polished and refined that the traditional Drie Fonteinen Gueuze.",4.63

Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,"A jet black pour with a fast tan head. The nose is insanely good-Sunday morning breakfast at grandma's with waffles, syrup, and bacon in a bottle. The drinking hits with sweet chocolate malts upfront, a smooth flow and a semi-dry finish. On the sweeter side of the spectrum but its not over-kill. There is a lot going on here. Big flowing flavors of sweet maple syrup, soft coffee grinds, and subtle smoke. Additional notes of vanilla, brown sugar, cocoa, and caramel. A rather moderate mouthfeel that offers a lush, rich, and creamy feel. Nothing to off-putting in terms of chalk or cola flavoring. ",4.91

Don’t know why I didn’t drink this when I bought it in the summer. Regardless, the nose is incredible. Everything is as described. Super roasty, sweet yet salty, and rich without being filling. A true dessert beer that finishes smooth and clean as a porter should versus this being a heavy stout. Hopefully I can try the 2019 fresh. Bravo FB!",4.53

Aurelian Lure,"Hazy pale color, almost no head. Aroma has fresh, unripe fruits like apricot, quince and mirabelles. Also quite spicy with some saffron and curry. Taste is tart and fruity with unripe apricot complete with skin. Really mineral on the finish. Light body, medium carbonation, really dry. A great, refreshing and really elegant sour.",4.6
Aurelian Lure,"one of the jester king beers that i have been unable to track down until now, highly acclaimed and on my list forever, stoked to finally have sourced it. its definitely one of the best apricot wild beers in the game, so intense and so natural at the same time, in a lot of ways reminds me of when i tried cascade apricot for the first time, and just realized that there was no more true expression of apricots in beer than that, this is the same, but much less sour, and with the classic jester king funky yeast mix that makes their beers so distinctive all the time. a pulpy orange hazy look to this one, under a short but lasting white head. the nose is incredible, the best feature of this for me and where i really appreciate the apricots most, fuzzy and real, fleshy and juicy and sweet and ripe, their absolute essence. some higher level bacterial acidity evident here too, but all in service of the fruit. nice oak to the flavor, gives it a richness, and a light wine and vanilla thing in the flavor, beautiful with the pale wheat malt and the sugars in the fruit, its funky and sour and also kind of desserty, a little more left at the end of this one than in a lot of their beers, especially these small bottle fruited releases, and i love how long it lingers. more sour than others too, especially at temperature, but it all works so well together. epic expression of apricots in a really amazingly funky and mature wild beer, up there with the best of jester king, and certainly worth all the hype!",4.52
Aurelian Lure,Blend 4.,4.5
Aurelian Lure,One of my all time favorites from JK. I have had each batch and while the most recent batch was not as good as ones in the past it is still one of the best sours they make.,4.79
Aurelian Lure,"Very nice apricot sour. Pours a golden color with subtle apricot notes. Tart on the tongue, but dry and subtle apricot notes become subtle apricot flavor on the palate. Great brew that I hope to have again",4.09
Aurelian Lure,"I had this at the release on tap, along side Fen Tao, and later in the bottle. I have to say, on tap was better which is like saying the sky is blue. In my opinion, apricot is one of the best fruits to go with sour beers and this is definitely one of the better sours JK makes. Deep apricot flavor, medium sourness, all deliciousness.",4.54

Aurelian Lure,"Hit of what I'm coming to understand is trademark JK funk, which is to say a little outhouse-y for me, but that settles down over time. On the palate, some light nectary apricot and a robust acidity that causes some throat burn by the end of the glass. A solid sour but nothing worth going out of your way for.",4.07

Aurelian Lure,This was incredibly delicious. I was hoping for something special as I was told it was great. But this blew me away. This was a phenomenal beer on a hot summer day. I hope I can find more...,4.73
Aurelian Lure,Pours gold. There's some pepper like particulate in the bottom of my glass.I'm not getting that much aroma. May be some jasmine. This beer is super dry with some juicy apricot flavors. I'm not getting a ton of sweetness.,4.22
Aurelian Lure,"Had this alongside an O'so Arbre Qui Donne (which, just as personal preference, I liked slightly better). Hazy orange-yellow color with very little head. Aroma was very funky, with the apricot complementing nicely. The taste was tart and crisp, with the best way I can describe it as 'funky fresh.' The apricots were there, but the funky and tart, slightly puckering mouthfeel that finished not as dry as expected are what make the beer special.",4.34
Aurelian Lure,One of my few perfect 5's. Better than Fou' Foune methinks. The scent is unreal. I kept sniffing and sniffing. The beer is sour but not an acid bomb. The interplay with the apricots is fantastic. Apricot is probably my favorite fruit in any sour. Truly a beer worth seeking out.,5

Aurelian Lure,Shared with JLindros.,4.36
Aurelian Lure,Another big thanks to rudzud.,4.27
Aurelian Lure,"Hazy orange body with a bubbly white head. Aromas of oak, vanilla, stone fruit. The apricot character is not especially assertive. While the beer is certainly tasty, it's less extraordinary than I hoped / expected. Lightly sweet, mild to medium tartness and a subtle acetic quality in the finish. Good stuff.",4.1
Aurelian Lure,Shared with a few non-craft friends. ,4.69
Aurelian Lure,"It's amazing to me how much more attention these fruited beers get. This is a fine liquid, but some of their standard stuff has so much more to offer on flavor, aroma, complexity, and mouthfeel.",4.2
Aurelian Lure,Slightly opaque golden yellow with 2 fingers of course chalky white head. Fruit is very apparent on the nose along with some back ground funk. Taste is dominated by minerality but the apricot is apparent on the back. Moderately sour that works extremely well with the fruit. Very clean finish.,4.31
Aurelian Lure,Poured from the 500 mL into a snifter.,4.46
Aurelian Lure,"Draught at Jester King. Pours a hazy bright golden color with not much head. Funk, apricots, wholly apricots Batman, and some tartness on the nose; follows onto the palate. Light bodied. Finishes tart and dry with plenty of lingering apricot fruit.",4.5
Aurelian Lure,"(From a 4 oz. tasting of batch 3.) Cloudy but representative apricot color, and the fruit comes through on the nose in a nice reserved way, and then the taste stays right in step with the pace and expectation of the lead-in. I'm not a fan of sours and citrus-forward beers, so this sweeter fruit theme is more to my liking and is a beautiful offering for the type.",4.49
Aurelian Lure,Had batch 3 fresh at JK at the release party and I think this was the best batch yet. So much sourness and nice notes of apricot on the nose and throughout the entire drink. The carbonation is perfect and the flavor is so complex.,4.54

Fuzzy Baby Ducks,"12oz. can served in a nonic. Canned 7/2/19. Pours a hazy, dull orange with a tight, one inch, bright white head. Nose is fairly subdued - subtle aromas of citrus, pith and biscuity malt with perhaps a kiss of tropical fruit at the back. Taste consistent with nose, albeit brighter and the tropical fruits notes are more pronounced towards the middle and a hint of herbal/medicinal bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel if light-medium, with an easy, even carbonation. Overall, tasty and quit edrinkable.",3.97

Fuzzy Baby Ducks,"I have not drunk many beers over the last few weeks life has been topsy turvy. I am so ready to get off this roller coaster. Fuzzy duck, like the name of this beer, the can art is awesome. The beer is 45 degrees and served in a pint glass. The head retention is excellent. The beer's head produced a two finger thick frothy, creamy and airy. The head left lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 6 a deep gold color with amber hues. The clarity of the beer is hazy. Overall the beer has a beautiful appearance. ",4.41

Fuzzy Baby Ducks,"Traded for this a while ago, as there wasn't a date on the bottom of the can. Wasn't sure what to expect out of this as the beer was quite old when I finally cracked it open, and although it wasn't bad, I don't see how it earned the lofty rating that it had on here...",4
Fuzzy Baby Ducks,"Pours a true hazy orange with two fingers of khaki foam after an eager pour. Head retention is good. Aroma is papaya, orange, mango, guava, pillowy yeast and clove. Tropical fruits are pronounced and sugary. Flavor profile carries more of the same qualities, with papaya, orange, mango, tangerine and guava sitting on the tongue for a long while after each sip. Light notes of yeast, and bready malts round out the flavor profile, but the balance is still very clearly tipped towards hops. Mouth feel is pillowy and creamy with a medium-thick consistency. Overall, sweet, but overly so. It clearly focuses on tropical fruits, but refrains from becoming cloyingly sweet - a refreshing NE IPA characteristic. ",4.28
Fuzzy Baby Ducks,"From a can, direct from the brewery. First impression was “this is no single ipa”. Tastes heavy to me, lush and potent. Bitter orange rind notes are most noticeable. good amount of bitter lingering... more than I expected. Finishes drier than I expected. There is a strong mineral character, an almost metallic tingle which, for me, takes over too much of the flavor. Here i was thinking this was a juicy neipa but Citra commonalities aside, this is a different animal. Im hoping it grows on me but it feels a bit “one note”. Im not blown away. Im maybe not as “citra-centric” as others so I shouldn’t be surprised that im not gaga over this. I see why people like it but... seems like a lot of hype surrounding this beer. My issue is that it starts exactly where it ends, it feels almost stingingly sharp with citrus... like your tongue is being zapped, but there isnt a depth to the experience... or a nuance to the hop profile... Again, one note. I normally really like single hop ipas but i think ive learned that citra does not have what im looking for, at least not when all by itself. All that said, it is excellent beer.",4.11

Fuzzy Baby Ducks,"Really excellent IPA. Finally got my hands on some fresh cans this weekend. Opaque pale orange with a lacy white head. Strong aromas of papaya and a whole range of citrus, especially orange. Medium bodied, smooth textured, and pleasantly dry throughout. Lighter and more refreshing, though less complex, than their DIPAs. Of course that's by design. NEBCO's got the winning recipes.",4.5

La Fosse,Had poured on-site at side project cellar from a 375ml bottle. Wow is it spectacular with a tart punch to the face that finishes smooth from the apricot. Very delightful mouth feel that makes this perfect for a summer day,4.68
La Fosse,Blend #3. ,4.42
La Fosse,"Finally got to rate this beer. B3 from bottle to glass, pours an opaque orange hue, a lot like the juice. Very fruity on the nose. The flavor profile to me is very similar to Fuzzy(I guess I should have an actual peach and apricot side by side to really know the difference), which in the end is why I am rating it the same. Beautiful beer, that I think Side Project has improved over previous batches, as the acidity levels have gone down quite significantly in my opinion.",4.45
La Fosse,L: Bold tangerine and dark orange hues with a thin wispy white head that recedes quickly,4.59
La Fosse,Batch 2 bottle poured into a Side Project wine glass. ,4.77
La Fosse,"Blend 2, consumed onsite at Side Project. Juicy apricots with a touch of oak and the signature Side Project yeast/sourness. Looks and smells incredible...very nicely done!",4.73
La Fosse,"i am surprised to learn this is the same base beer as fuzzy, which to me wasnt anywhere near this sour, this beer seems way more acidic to me, but maybe thats the impact of the different fruits on it or of its relative maturity, i really dont know. either way, this is up there with the very best beers i have had from side project to date. pale hazy lambic looking beer, with a fizzy white head that dissipates fast. the aroma is the best part for me, woody bretty funk with citrusy bacterial tang over a pale wheaty base, it is lambic at its core it seems, but the fruit is so vibrant here, soft super ripe apricots, their absolute essence, intense and amazingly enticing. sometimes apricots and peaches can be a little samey in beers, depending on how they are used, but there is no mistaking these apricots! so true to the real fruit, in its best form. the flavor is like that too, with a lot of the sourness and wild yeast flavor (and wood) on the front end, and all the fruit showing up later on. i like the progression of flavors moving this way, the fruit lingers long in the finish, but the beer is very dry. its a step more sour than it needs to be i think, it sort of hurts the teeth like that, has an overdeveloped bacterial sting, and sits litle vinegary in the belly. still nice bretty notes about, as fruity as the apricots themselves. great carbonation and a very light body. a very special beer, and perhaps as good an apricot wild beer as has been made in the states...",4.39
La Fosse,batch 2 drank at side project on 3/28/2016,4.58
La Fosse,"Batch2 from the bottle release today. Look is opaque light orange. Smell is light funk at first, eggy, then heavy apricots as it warms. Taste is amazing. Sour then apricots all over the place. More apricots as it warms up. Dry finish. Wife and I have had almost all of the fruited sours and this is by far the best we've ever had from Side Project. They really hit the nail on the head with this one. This beer explodes apricots all over the place. Really really tasty.",4.75
La Fosse,"Had at CBC 2016. I love sour beers, and there were some great ones there. This one was simply too much though; everything that would probably make this beer great as well gets overshadowed by the extreme sourness. Without a doubt the most sour beer I've ever had. As a bit of a novelty , definitely worth trying. But man, my teeth hated me after this one.",3.83
La Fosse,A: Rich golden orange but has no head or carb to speak of,3.87
La Fosse,"First SP fruited beer. La Fosse is fine, pretty good even, but it suffers from the overwhelming amount of acidity (reminded me of Upland). I definitely don't think it's worth what it trades for. If you want Apricots, I think nearly every other similar beer is much better (Aurelian Lure, Apricot Bu, Apricot Fruit Stand, Fou Foune, West Ashley, etc).",4.25
La Fosse,This is straight battery acid. Batch one and batch two are just straight acid. Batch one was even more so than batch two. This is easily the worst side project beer I've had to date. This will be a preference thing though. Both of my friends liked it while I poured the rest of mine in their glasses,3.24
La Fosse,"This beer definitely has apricot in it. The smell is there and the taste is there along with some punch you in the face sourness. This beer is very acidic and funky and plays well with the fruit. Did a side by side with Map of the Sun and de Garde's Imperial Apricot and this came in 2nd to DG, Map came in a distant 3rd.",4.11
La Fosse,The beer pours a golden yellow with minimal head. ,4.5
La Fosse,"375 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Very hazy orange body. Small white head. Strong apricot aroma. Oak. White wine. And immediately the taste is incredibly sour. The sourest apricots I can imagine. Overwhelming. Really great apricot flavor, but it just gets so sour. Just a bit of oak and white wine remain. Low carbonation. It’s good, but so sour. Completely covers up anything else going on.",3.34
La Fosse,Lots of apricot with a moderate funk to the aroma. Sweet apricots mix with funky and musty sourness in the taste. A little sharp in the finish. Excellent overall.,4.46
La Fosse,"The beer is an orange juice gold color. Smallish white head. Very cloudy. Head dissipates quickly. The aroma is big on apricots. Pretty good lacto note. Not much funk. Quite a nice juicy fruit aroma. The taste is very sour. You get some nice fruit but the acidity is just too aggressive for me. There seems to be a nice beer hidden underneath that monster sour kick, and it's a real shame that you can't really taste it well. Some oak - a bit of a buttery white wine flavor - and apricots come through, but both are well in the background. Mostly lacto sourness, mostly just tastes like neutral acidity. Big pucker. Lots of back of the throat sour, phlegmy feeling in the finish. Fairly light body. As I wrote before, there's a good beer in there, but it's so sour that you lose complexity and depth of flavor.",3.52
La Fosse,"Pours a fantastic golden yellow, similar to the color on the label. Nose is full of sour and some peachy fruitiness gently in the background.",4.47
La Fosse,"Imcredible beer. Only had a small 3 oz sample at the FWIBF into a 6 oz snifter. The stone fruit shines and is comimented nicely with the puckering sour of the lactic acid. For a Side Project, these brews continue to take on starring roles!",4.99
La Fosse,A. Cloudy golden orange in color. Thin ring of white foam and minimal lacing.,4.56
La Fosse,"Undrinkable due to the acidity. Had higher hopes for this one but it was a drain pour for me. Maybe a bad bottle, but see others with similar comments.",3.41

DFPF,"Tasted from bottle. Pours a bright ruby red with pink head. Nice fruit aroma. Berries and passionfruit nose. Taste is super tart with sweet fruity flavors. Don’t remember what dragonfruit tastes like. I get lots of berries, strawberries, with some tropical fruit notes. I’m not a huge Berliner or sour fan but this is very nice.",4.12
DFPF,Poured from a bomber into a taster. Thanks Ryan for sharing. ,4.54
DFPF,"What?!? Have you seen what this stuff looks like?? Bright fuchsia liquid glowing in my glass. Absolutely astonishing to look at. Nose is all passion fruit...smells amazing. Taste is also all passion fruit with some perfect tartness to finish. Feel is excellent and dry. Overall, this is an amazing berliner and hands down, the most insane looking beer I've ever seen.",4.85

DFPF,2016 (batch 1) drank on 2/4/2017,4.44
DFPF,Bottle: Poured a copper/pink color beer with a medium size foamy head. Aroma of raspberry vinegar with some ripe mango notes is quite unique. Taste is also a mix of ripe fruit notes with some mango and other tropical fruit notes with some tart and raspberry vinegar notes. Body is full for style with good carbonation. Unique take on the style and something I wish I could drink again.,4.38
DFPF,"Just gorgeous to look at - I almost didn't want to drink it. Like Miami Madness, it has a crazy low abv, so you can sip it all day long by the pool. DFPF >MM btw.",4.41
DFPF,"now this is what i am talking about! this is how you use tropical fruit in a sour beer! splendid stuff, gives me a new respect for the brewery, and despite how the hype train rolls, i would drink this over their highly acclaimed maimi madness any day! brilliant fuschia pink color, not a ton of head, but electric, like some of the intense hibiscus beers out there, looks almost unnatural from the dragon fruit, but the aroma and flavor of both fruits is incredibly authentic. super fruit forward, the natural tartness of the passion fruit is a perfect addition to the already quite acidic and sour base beer, clean lemony lacto allowed to really develop. perfect ph for the fruit i think, max flavor extraction, a touch of sweetness, but i can still taste the wheat underneath it all. good carbonation, dramatic fruit flavors, just short of perfumey intense, concentrated, not for everyone i am sure. i loved how the fruits go together so well, and together with the sourness, awesome how low alcohol it is too! this is sensational beer that deserves the high praise it is receiving! nothing else like this exists to my knowledge. without question the best beer with dragon fruit i have ever had!",4.48
DFPF,"This might be my favorite Berliner of all time. I managed to get 5 pours of this at GABF last weekend, and I would have gotten more if I had more time. This is insanely sour, fruity, and perfectly carbed.",4.78

DFPF,**REVIEW NUMBER 900**,4.56
DFPF,Had been saving this one to share with a friend for quite some time and we finally had the time to get together and drink it! This one did not disappoint! Deep purple hue and mountains of fruit!! Probably the best Berliner I've ever had! Amazing stuff!!!,4.77
DFPF,"Bottle pour into a taster. Gorgeous beer! Huge, huge, huge tropical fruit, particularly passion fruit. One of the best berliners I've had a chance to try.",4.66
DFPF,The most beautiful purple pink I have ever seen. It looks like juice. Sparking with color. Rhubarb hue to it. Wow.,4.53
DFPF,"The color, deep rich magenta, and the nose, total passion fruit bomb, were absolutely amazing! Taste was basically passion fruit juice without any detectable ""beer-ness"" other than carbonation, which left me somewhat undecided as part of me thinks a beer should taste a little like beer. That said, the usually enamel ripping sourness of de Garde Bu way down and you get JWB berliner, which to me sets THE high bar for all others.",4.55
DFPF,"Amazing color to this beer. Lighter purple color. Great flavor. Lots of passion fruit. Just a touch of tartness. In general, this is not my preferred style of beer, but this was great.",4.5
DFPF,Pours a magenta pink red color. Aroma is tart with a light sweetness. Flavor is really nice. It's tart but still light and refreshing. Has some citrus tropical fruit notes and overall is a really nice drinking experience.,4.38
DFPF,"It looks like a magenta highlighter. The head is just a shade lighter purple/pink. The dragonfruit is the color, but the passionfruit is the star of the show. The nose and taste are all passionfruit with a perfect light tartness. Quenching, fruity, and delicious.",4.71
Sosus,"This was one of my many purchases from Tavour before we parted CANpony. I hold no animosity towards them, it was just that their local shipping company was as flexible as an I-beam & I grew tired of arguing with their dispatcher. Tavour apparently has/had a CANtract with them so they could not offer any relief. Oh well. Today is TGBC Day @ Chez Woody! ",4.09
Sosus,Bottled 11/11/15; drank 11/21/15 @ Harvest Hop Haus. ,3.75
Sosus,"Wow, pours a cloudy golden haze topped by a silky white head that makes way for sticky lacing. Tonnes of sediment swirling around from top to bottom. A beautiful sight. Tropical fruit hops on the nose. Big, bold flavors of pineapple and orange envelop your whole head as you dive in. Extremely sessionable for a heavyweight. I simply cannot take the glass away more than an inch from my face. When I'm not drinking it I'm breathing it. Top class IIPA that seemingly hasn't suffered from a round the world trip, and well deserving of the honour of my 1000th BA review!",4.48
Sosus,Juice bomb. Poured 16 oz can into a tulip glass. Pours a hazy golden yellow. With about an inch of head that is lacing down the glass as I drink it. Get quite a bit of fruity citrus aromas. Get a hint of pine as well. Taste orange and apricot. Nice bitterness. Another great beer from Toppling.,4.5

Sosus,"Smell is beautiful combo of pineapple and orange. Taste is orange and citrus, light malt and deep ripe fruit on the back of the palette. Mouthfeel is somewhat on the dry side. Really nice NEIPA.",4.3
Sosus,"16oz can. Pours a slightly hazy golden orange with 2 inches of frothy head. Tons of lacing. Sweet aroma of tropical fruits. Pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit and guava. The taste is mostly the guava and pineapple but a fair amount of bready malts this time. Tangerine, grapefruit and pineapple finish. Creamy and soft with a dry mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable for having a higher ABV. Worth seeking out.",4.24
Sosus,"I love me some mosaic, and this one checks all the boxes. Great look, feel and nose complement the juicy flavor. Nothing to complain about here, sneaky crushable at 8%.",4.52
Sosus,"Pours a golden orange with a bit of haze. A large frothy head retains well, and yields lots of foamy and thick lacing.",4.34
Sosus,"Opaque gold with a dense creamy white foam head. Nose is earthy herbal and dank, lime green, floral, blueberry, melons, tropical fruit, a little bready, with citrus and resinous pine. Tastes like a beautiful representation of Mosaic with blueberry notes, honeydew melon, tropical mango, pineapple, lemon, grapefruit, orange citrus pith, light crackery bready malt, some earthy herbal dankness, lemongrass and bitter resinous pine. Feels soft and juicy, medium plus bodied, creamy smooth with moderate low carbonation. Overall a really nice Mosaic hopped DIPA.",4.71
Sosus,"I am drinking this on tap at Lake and Irving. It smells citrusy and lemony with some light fruit and light floral. It is hazy gold under a 1/2"" white cap. the flavors are spicy, citusy and lemony with a medium plus bitterness and a rich malt flavor in the background. It is very creamy with a medium body and carbonation. A solid brew.",4.5
Sosus,"Sosus pours a hazyish copper color, with chunks, and a small lacing head. Big creamy hoppy aroma. Flavor is creamy, nice hop flavors, a good bitterness, and a nice little kick at the end. Good body and feel. Overall, very good beer, a little bit hoppier and bitter for a NEIPA.",4.46
Sosus,Canned on 12-07-2018 with a best by date of 04-06-2019 and opened and drank on 02-13-2019. Very light in quality IPA tastes. Decent hops aroma but very light otherwise.,3.79
Sosus,"Pours orange that nears on opaque in terms of transparency. Head is just north of two fingers of foam in the color white. Head retention is good. Aroma is pineapple, mango and melon dew all right on the front end. As these heavy tropical fruits fade, mango, orange, and lemongrass come on with hints of bready, toasty malts behind it all. Pineapple is the big player here. Flavor profile is mango, tangerine, melon dew, orange, and herbal/sticky hops with pineapple coming on big at the end. Tropical fruits start and finish it, with the middle focusing more on orange juice and bready, earthy malts. It definitely has a fruit smoothie sort of taste. Mouth feel has a touch of grain at the onset and then fades away quickly to produce a semi-textured and chalky, soft feel. It has a medium-thick consistency. Overall, big pineapple, this NE IPA covers up its 8% ABV extremely well. That said, it's sweet enough that consumption is limited to sips, but not sweet enough that it becomes cloying or burdening. ",4.14
Sosus,"On tap, pours a lightly hazy deep gold. Smell and taste really show the Mosaic, with a good combination of berries, tropical fruit and some earthy herbs. Sharpish carbonation. Good stuff.",4.46
Sosus,A great DIPA from Topplong Goliath! This one had great hope and great depth to its taste and great one for sure. But up against King Sue it’s amazing but I like King Sues more citrus pop to it. So this is great for those that love a strong DIPA and want a less fruity bang. Still a winner in my book!!,4.5

Canned at the Toppling Goliath brewery in Decorah, Iowa on 12/7/18. 16 oz canned poured into pint glass. Hazy golden pour, light white head and lacing. Very sweet citrus aroma. Nicely balanced taste, citrus and pineapple sweetness balanced by slightly bitter hops. This is the type of balanced NE IPA I prefer over very sweet offerings. Mouth feel somewhat dry, carbonation holds well but mild, very easy drinking IPA. Overall excellent pour and offering by Toppling Goliath, glad I have three more left!",4.32
Sosus,"Pours a hazy bright yellow with a large white head with staying power, great lacing. Aroma is full of fruity hops.

Adam From The Wood,"A classic. This one is 2018. It looks just as it should, calm and a little dangerous. The nose waves a baseball bat worth of flavors around behind its back and says “I’m going the hit you with this, very soon”. Raisin/cherry fruit tones come to the fore, backed by brandy and vanilla cookies. And of course, the taste does indeed clobber you with huge crescendo of coffee, fruit, booze, char, leather and umami. Fantastic. The mouthfeel, again, is just as it should be. This is a unique beer and very much deserves its high reputation. Speaking from experience, and without any fear of contradiction, I can also report that this beer ages beautifully.",4.49
Adam From The Wood,"2018 vintage. Really excited to find this at the brewery while visiting Portland. As expected, absolutely no sound when the cap was taken off. Zero carbonation, which immediately seems strange. Pours a gorgeous dark brown. The nose is incredible. Reminds me of a 30 year old English barleywine. Tons of oak, caramel, alcohol-soaked cherries, leather, sweet molasses. This, to me, smells old and delicious. Taste is crazy. Immediately picking up strong nutty flavors. The lack of carbonation conveys a syrupy taste. Picking up lots of dark cherries, blackberries, toffee, burnt wood bitterness, leather, rubber, oak, and maybe a hint of soy sauce. Mouthfeel is creamy and thick - very bold. Overall, this is a mesmerizing beer with a deep hierarchy of flavors. Absolutely fantastic, and an experience I won't forget.",4.74

Adam From The Wood,"2015. Dark brown pour with just a few bubbles that do not amount to any type of head. Smells of caramel, dark fruits, chocolate, tobacco and oak. Tastes of dark fruit with sweet flavors of chocolate, toffee, brown sugar blending perfectly with flavors of soy, oak, bourbon, leather and tabacco. Almost zero carbonation with a slightly sticky mouth feel that helps give this virtually flat beer some body. Overall, an amazingly delicious and complex BA old ale. The lack of carbonation may throw some people off, but doesn't take away from the drinking experience to me.",4.54
Adam From The Wood,"It's definitely a unique beer, but not one I think I'd care to repeat. Maybe my pallet has been ruined by too many IPAs, but this beer just wasn't for me.

Bodhi,"Gifted to me by @leperjim. Bottled 6/3. Clear dark bronze color, minimal head and lacing. Mildly dank sharp hop smell, little bit of pine. Taste is bitter and bold hops. Feel is crisp, clean, mouth watering and medium body. Excellent “old style” IPA.",4.53

Bodhi,Copper colored with a murky complexion. There’s a fingernail of dishwater white around the rim and covering the majority of the top. Light lacing is present. The aroma is of tangerine and pine. I’m tasting tangerine and citrus fruit. The mouth is very resinous and lightly sticky.,4.14
Bodhi,"My buddy had been begging me to try this saying it is the best brewed beer in Ohio. We have similar tastes in IPAs so I decided to give it a try. It was a 22 ounce draft. The look is a nice dark golden color. The aroma is a nice blend of citrus and pine hops. The taste is the same. These balance of flavors mask the 8.3% alcohol content. Definitely can drink this down pretty quick and get a nice buzz. The beer is super smooth and has a nice dry finish. Definitely having it again at some point. Very, very impressed. May be Ohio's best IPA.",4.86
Bodhi,"Received a single, twelve ounce bottle as a part of a trade almost a year ago. Looking through top-rated beers, and realized that I forgot to review. I did not trade for this, it was included as a bonus-brew. Not distributed to MA. Pleasantly surprised, very nice brew.",4.5

Bodhi,"Bodhi brewed by Columbus Brewing Company, with an ABV of 8.50% This American Imperial IPA pours out of a 12 oz bottle into a pint beer glass a nice golden amber color. There is also a nice white head on top of this brew with a nice amount of lacing. The lacing sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with hop bitterness, a slight citrus flavor, with earthy grains and malts. There is a lot going on in Bodhi. So far this is a nice inviting brew, now for the taste. It is rich and bold with flavors. You first pick up on the hop bitterness with citrus flavors. The body of Bodhi is a medium to heavy but not to heavy. It is really hard to pick up on the 8.50% ABV in this brew. It goes down this smooth, the citrus flavors are a nice touch to this brew. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a super nice balance to it. If you are a fan of IPA'S you should look this brew up. The mouth feel is Hoppy, Bold ,Rich, Clean , Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I'm going to give Bodhi a 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to. Columbus Brewing Company, did a real nice job with this IPA.",4.18
Bodhi,Wonderful balance of malt and citrusy hops. Attractive on the eye with a golden color with white head that rescinds into nice lacing. Remarkable is the mouthfeel - super easy to drink and masking its DIPA qualities. Citrusy on the nose and palate. Wonderful beer.,4.86
Bodhi,"A wonderful full flavor , earthy , multi-layered beer. Pours a Beautiful deep copper with a thick off white head. Mostly a deep earthy smell with some citrus , flower undertones . Fills the mouth with flavor but is still somewhat subtle at first taste and isn’t overwhelming . Keeps you curious for the next taste . A great beer",4.48

Bodhi,"L- poor as a slightly hazy golden orange color with a very thin, white head that just collects on the ring outside the glass. Has a little bit of carbonation.",4.57
Bodhi,"Pours a clear deep gold/pale amber coloration with a medium, fizzy head. Smells of biscuity malt with hoppy accents of citrus and light tropical fruit: grapefruit, tangerine, mango, and a hint of grass. Taste is a great balance of biscuity, lightly sweet malt and bright, hoppy, slightly zesty citrus and tropical fruit notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lime, mango and and papaya. There is a light resinous quality to this as well, with a hint of grass and pine. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some pine lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and medium/lively carbonation. This seems like somewhere inbetween an Old School and West Coast IPA, but in a really good way. Great balance of malts and hops, sweetness and bitterness. Not a hint of booze or bubble gum to this, which is impressive given the 8.5% ABV. This actually drinks surpringly easy.",4.25
Bodhi,"I had a 4 ounce pour of this in a bar in downtown Columbus. Like so many imperial IPAs, I loved the hop taste, but found the overall quality to be marred by a boozy taste. It's a good beer, but many other IPAs pack as much taste with less alcohol.",4.25
Bodhi,"Pours a slightly hazy golden with a nice big white foamy head that lingers for quite a while. Aroma is a bit off - faint pine, citrus, I think the off smell is actually a big grapefruit pith aroma. Big beer here - loads of hops: piney, lots of citrus - orange, lemon, grapefruit. Great balance of hops and malt, nice amount of bitterness the whole way through. Classic west coast style DIPA, definitely a go to beer.",4.06

Bodhi,"This is a great beer. Similar to thier standard IPA, but more hoppy and much stronger. Can only have a couple and you must go down in abv. Color is deeper yellow. Smell is very skunky. Flavor is fantastic. 12oz bottle Columbus, oh. 16oz draft at Pastimes Pub New Albany Oh.",4.85
Bodhi,"Thanks to WesMantooth for this one, from a ninja box during NBS BIF #007. 12oz bottle poured into 10oz fluted tulip. Poured a beautiful, clean, clear, bright golden color with about 1/2 inch of white head that had good retention and light-medium lace.",3.84
Bodhi,"Pours a slightly foggy yellow with a finger and a half of white head. Head retention is fair with a few strands of lacing left behind. Aroma is delicate notes of orange, lemon zest, and papaya with slightly more dense notes of biscuit, pale, and bread malts. Flavor profile is lemon zest, papaya, orange, and mango. Biscuit, and pale malts hide behind, but provide a consistent base. Mouth feel is medium in terms of thickness, with a grainy, semi-harsh carbonation feel. Overall, a great DIPA. Lovely hop qualities that are far from overpowering. It's a well balanced beer with great flavor.",4.46
Bodhi,"Now that is some tremendously understated label artwork there. I was both excited to try it (hype! I've heard so much on NBS!), and underwhelmed by the appearance so not super inclined to get in to it. It had to be done! Rather than share this one (as I've done with several IPAs I've recently received) I elected to drink this one alone... and I do not regret that decision (sorry/not sorry, share buddies).",4.38

Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"750 ml bottle into snifter; 2018 vintage, bottle #4949. Pours opaque dark brown/black color with a small fairly dense khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to a minimal spotty lace cap that lingers. Minimal spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, bourbon, toasted oak, roasted nuts, biscuit, and dark/brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of vanilla, coconut, licorice, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, smoke, charcoal, leather, tobacco, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malts, moderate bourbon barrels, and light fruity yeast/earthy hop notes; with big strength. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, bourbon, toasted oak, roasted nuts, biscuit, and dark/brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of vanilla, coconut, licorice, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, smoke, charcoal, leather, tobacco, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Very mild herbal, grass, roast, charred bitterness; and bourbon/oak tannin spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, bourbon, toasted oak, roasted nuts, biscuit, dark/brown bread/crust, vanilla, coconut, licorice, dark fruit, smoke, charcoal, leather, tobacco, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, moderate bourbon barrels, and light fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; with a nice roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with no cloying, acrid, astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness. Light-medium carbonation and very full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety/bready, and lightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is fantastic, Minimal warming alcohol for 10%, with no lingering barrel booze after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged Russian imperial stout. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, moderate bourbon barrels, and light fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the big ABV, with the minimally bitter/tannic/drying finish. Fantastic soft feel. Not as much barrel as I expected, but adequate. Fantastic rich malt complexity; solid barrel presence/integration, restrained fruity yeast, and mild earthy hops. Not overly sweet/heavy from lingering dryness. A highly enjoyable offering, and impressive spot on style example.",4.25
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"Jet black with a dark brown head that retreats to the edges of the glass. The aroma is an amazing blend of bourbon, coffee, dark chocolate, raisins and caramel. The taste is exactly the same as the smell with the bourbon up front and the rest of the flavors coming in after that. There is a nice bitterness that lingers with the sweetness of the raisins and caramel at the end. Just a delicious stout.",4.66
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"2019 bottle. 12oz, 11% ABV.",4.55
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,Really slick and tasty and does everything I’d want for a bba Stout. There is a nice caramel sweetness and the nose that really perseveres through the line. This is a sweet beer all things considered. But I appreciate the well constructed layers,4.28
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"Ok, so I recently picked up some of these down here in Milwaukee. Never had it before, was on my want list for several years now. ",4.56
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"2019 vintage. Have had most of Lift Bridge's offering and found them to be good but not exceptional; Silhouette is the latter. Pours pitch black with some light barely visible at the top edge in my Spiegelau stout glass. Delicious meld of coffee and bourbon on the nose. Flavor profile goes together perfectly, not too much bourbon but the perfect amount IMHO and not too boozy but just right. Nice full body but not too much either. This is fantastic and given the choice of this or some of the better know BA stouts like BCBS, CBS or KBS I've enjoyed, I'd pick this over them.",4.73
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,2019 version poured from a 12 oz. bottle on 1-27-19.,4.6
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,Pours pitch black with a medium mocha colored head. Smells great with notes of barrel present but not overpowering. Tastes like a lot of chocolatey goodness and roasted coffee. Very rich feel and taste. Great barrel taste and balance. Think this reminds me a lot of BA Expedition.,4.59
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,Thank you Vidblain for this,4.55

Barrel-Aged Silhouette,Poured from 750ml bottle into glass. 2018 vintage.,4.46
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"Outstanding BA stout. It’s got tons of chocolatey sweetness and a very pronounced, but not dominating barrel character. The bourbon blends perfectly with the big malty flavors of dark fruit, and chocolate. The mouthfeel is super thick and coating, perfect for the style. Overall I’ll be making the effort to get this again, it’s great.",4.56
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"Very good barrel aged russian imperial stout. Doesn't meet the hype, but does not disappoint either. The body did meet the hype, with a roasty, thick, and boozy feel all the way through the glass. The taste was a bit smoky, with the bourbon and malt leading the charge with aftertastes of dark chocolate, oat and tobacco. Very enjoyable, would have again on a cold winter night",4.05
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,2017 vintage.,4.45
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"2018 bomber, and I'm very excited to be able to try this one. Pours black and moderately thick but not syrupy, with very little head that eventually burbles up from below. The nose is a bit subdued, with cacao nibs, vanilla, red wine tannins, and malt balls, plus a tiny hint of black cherry and plum on occasion. Big bourbon notes on the tongue that amplify the aromas and provide some spice. Punching above its weight class at 10% abv. A nice, moderately full mouthfeel and boozy finish. ",4.41
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,Poured from a 22oz bomber into a snifter glass. Thanks Ryan for sharing this one. ,4.11
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"2017 bottle poured into a teku. Dark brown with a subtle head. Aroma is nice...barrel, vanilla, toffee and chocolate. Subtle hints of molasses and dark fruit. Taste really let me down. Minimal barrel, slight booziness with some dark fruit and molasses. Feel is onthe thinner side. Wanted it to be more viscous. Overall, good beer but don’t see the hype.",4.12
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,On tap at 2018 release patty. ,4.57
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"Good chocolate and a little heat on the nose. Solid flavor that backed up the aroma, but the thin mouthfeel and bit of heat were not to my liking. Overall a solid brew though",4.08
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,Very dark appearance with slight tan head. Aroma is a nice bourbon with a touch of vanilla. The taste is a mild bourbon that is a little weak for my taste.,4.27
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"2016 vintage, poured into a taster. Chocolate forward, rounded out by nice bourbon barrel notes. A bit thin and hot, which detracted from the overall experience.",4.21
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,An extremely solid Barrel Aged RIS! Not too boozy but the bourbon is definitely there just well hidden. Tons of chocolate on the nose and palate. Would track this one down again for sure! 2015 Vintage,4.79

Art,"2014 bottle poured into a stemmed tulip at the brewery. Pours a clear gold color with substantial head that dissipates quick. Aroma is lemongrass, subtle vinegar, hay and funk. Taste is all that and then some...very balanced. Some lemon acidity and funk is prominent. Very nice! Feel is what I’d expect for this style of beer. Overall, this is a magnificent and elegant brew. So deliciously tart and also balanced.",4.74

Art,Art b5 served from 375ml at the brewery.,4.59
Art,"Pours gold - a slight bit of haze with a puffy 3 finger head that leaves big rings of lace. Aromas of earthy brett, lemon, white grape, hay and oak - very complex. Taste is spot on - light Oaked malts balanced with a hint of dry white grape, green apple, lemongrass, white pepper and very slight bitterness and sourness - VERY easy to drink.",4.74
Art,"How does a Farmhouse Ale get any better than this. Beautiful brilliant golden color with a foamy fluffy sticky head that lasts and sticks to the glass with a dense honeycomb lacing. The wine and oak tones are well balanced with the base ale. Wonderful nose, smooth mouth feel, must try!",4.75
Art,"750ml bottle, batch 4. Served in a snifter glass. Pours a clear golden-yellow body, slight straw hue, one finger thick white head, good retention, not much lacing. Smell is brilliant funk, white vinous character, mild-moderate vinegar acidity, light oak, minerals, a bit of underripe peach. Wonderful stuff, so complex. Flavour is similar; there is more of a moderate acidic presence behind the oak and white vinous character. Light cereal grain, mineral and cobweb funk. This is one of the best saisons as far as the flavour goes; the complexity is fantastic. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, tart and a little dry, and the glass seems to empty itself a bit too quickly, strangely enough. Vinous and light vinegar acidity finishes things off. Overall, fantastic beer that is up there amongst the best of the style.",4.71
Art,"Beautiful, almost opaque straw color. Aroma is white wine, oak barrel, warming alcohol, various stone fruit aromas. The taste follows with oaky, dry white wine. Plums and apricots and a slight alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is perfect for the style, on the thinner side with a good level of carbonation. Overall, another great beer from HF. Expertly blended and look forward to saving my other bottle for a while!",4.68

Art,L: Golden yellow pour with minimal head and visible lacing. ,4.79
Art,"Awesome beer. Wine barrel present, expands on what I love about Arthur. Soft, citrus presence. Makes me want more and more of this. Would bang again!",4.94
Art,"Batch 4 (thanks Mike!) served in a HF tulip. Pours a burnished orange hue with a frothy, off-white head that dissipates into a bubbly band around the edges. Nose expresses vinous notes, a hint of vanilla and a trace of apple cider vinegar. Taste consistent with nose; however, the flavor profile comes off a bit watered down. There's also the addition of lemon peel. Mouthfeel is light in body with a soft carbonation and a mild acidity. Overall, quite tasty but not sure it lives up to the hype.",4.14
Art,"Bottle. Poured a hazy yellow color. Aroma was bright, rustic, funky, and tart with some wet woody/cork. Flavor was still much like regular Arthur but a bit more intensified and with a wine and wood addition. I haven't had Arthur in a while but it stills seems rather closely tied to Art; not an absurd transformation. I love the farmy/rustic quality that Hill Farmstead's farmhouse beers finish with. Really delightful.",4.39
Art,"Batch 4, bottled 5/21/2015. ",4.9
Art,"Pours a rich golden grain. Minimal white foam. Vinous funk aroma. It's soft and delicate, lightly tart, vinous but subtly so. A little cheese funk comes out as it warms. There's a little bitterness on the finish. Just a touch. Overall, a very good wine barrel farmhouse ale.",4.31
Art,"A- Pours a beautiful golden hue, with hints of orange. A medium sized white head slowly recedes and leaves ample lacing.",4.81
Art,"A: Gold, white head that sticks around forever. Hazy, great looking beer. S: Funky...so much funk. That Hill yeast smell, some oak and lemon. T: Lemon, funk, oak, hay, basement...all I want in a beer. M: Carb is right where it needs to be. Keeps it soft and finishes dry, making you want more. O: This beer is exactly what I wanted it to be and more. It's oaky, funky and perfect. Way to go Shaun, you never disappoint",5
Art,Purchased one year ago at the source. Pours a cloudy yellow. Aroma is super funky. Taste largely follows. As it warms it becomes much better. Not sure I get much wine barrel in this.,4.34
Art,"B3, hoppypocket, can't thank you enough. Tons of barrel on the nose. Tons of wine barrel, good mineral notes, decent sour. Different and not quite what I was expecting (not in a bad way) would drink again ;-)",4.49
Art,"Perfect slighly hazy golden color. Was extremely active in the bottle before pouring. The smell was pleasantly funky and tart...you can smell it the second it pours. The taste blew me away...zero flaws as far as I'm concerned. Everything good about Arthur with the added complexity and tartness from the wine barrels. Even has a bit of vanilla flavor in the aftertaste which was very nice. Less carbed than I was expecting and that's not a bad thing...almost creamy, which I didn't expect either but I really really enjoy. This may just be the best beer I've ever had. Wish I could drink this every day.",5
Art,"wow--- what a funky nose---apple meets barnyard funkiness... however, the flavor is a little more restrained and not quite up to the nose... a seriously delicious BA saison, but I have to agree with another reviewer, its no le sarrasin!... next up is Ann so ill have to see how it matches up.... life is rough!",4.48
Art,"Batch 3 at a bottle share. This is a stunner and greatly exceeded my expectations. I actually liked this better than Ann, so I'm a bit surprised by the lower ratings.",5

Matt,2013 version on tap at the 25th anniversary party. ,4.77
Matt,"Gifted from @lingenbrau. I thought it lost carbonation, but he told me their stuff is normally under carbed. Either way, it's a winner. Dark muddy brown color. Smell is boozy, oaky, apply. Taste is the old ale style, malty, strong booze, sweet, smoky, woody barrel and apple notes. Smooth, mild burn, trying not to hold the lack of carb against it as I'm not sure if that was how it was intended. Very good.",4.56
Matt,2016 bottle poured into a snifter glass. ,3.72
Matt,"Another unique and wonderful brew from HOTD. I’d call it somewhere between an American Strong and an Old Ale, but that doesn’t matter because it’s just delicious. After a couple years in my cellar the carbonation has suffered a bit, but many of HOTD’s offerings start out that way, so it doesn’t seem a problem. Nose and taste are both truly world class, so complex and so well integrated that I can’t begin to describe them - you just have to be here!",4.37
Matt,"This one pours a very dead looking and murky purplish brown, with no head and no lacing.",3.56
Matt,"Hardly zero head or carbonation in a 2013. Taste was bourbon soaked raisans. Sweet but quite pleasant. It didn't look great and it was prob a little thin for the abv and the barrel, but defintely respect the old ale style and would not turn it down again.",4.26
Matt,2016 ventage. Dark appearance with no head. Aroma is nutty. Taste is also nutty bourbon with a fairly strong sharp alcohol bite. This should be aged longer to eliminate the alcohol taste.,4.19
Matt,L: pours thick brown with no head at all. No hiss when I opened the cap...still,3.53
Matt,"Had been sitting on this for a long time. Wow! Absolutely delicious. A little on the sweet side but very tasty. Soy sauce, tobacco, cocoa, definitely a sipper.",4.35
Matt,Was lucky enough to finally track down a bottle of Matt and enjoy it with a friend. Strong caramel flavors in this Old Ale. Very tasty but absolutely a sipper as this was strong and boozy. Solid but wouldn't probably track it down again.,4.5
Matt,"While I wasn't blown away by AFTW, this beer rocked my world! I love the flavor complexities, and enjoyed sipping on this for quite a while. I know it's on the top 250 but I never see anyone talking about it. And they should be.",4.68
Matt,"all of the beers we had at hair of the dog were highlights, so its hard to single out this 2008 matt as the standout, but it was pretty darn impressive. no idea what it tasted like fresh, but some time in the bottle has really done it well. one of the few beers i can think of that could stand up over time like this, not a lick of oxidation or staleness in here at all, just a smooth mellow well integrated brew all the way around. rich syrupy viscous dark dark brown pour, still with a little bubbling head on it. notes of campfire, black licorice, cigar, brandy, raisin, and dark chocolate all waft out from the glass slowly and patiently, weaving a complex aromatic tapestry that is entirely unique. burnt leather and bourbon come through the dark english or german malts, rauch type smoke has mellowed some, sticky bread pudding, root beer, then they apple grappa stuff in the finish. man is this layered! it doesnt quite have that roasted barley stout quality to it, it doesnt go that deep, but in its bitter absence, there arises this space for other flavors usually lost to it, and i think this lands perfectly in the middle of all of them. i am amazed how this has done over time, i expected more of a novelty at this age, but that wasnt the case at all. rich and velvety on the palate, the warming alcohol seems necessary too. brilliant beer, what a treat!",4.38

Matt,2013 bottle poured into a teku.,4.57
Matt,"2013 bottle at the brewery. Delicious with tons of awesome dark fruit flavors and just a bit of apple. Extremely drinkable, and carbed which helps matters significantly. Just a bit of smoke which is pretty much the perfect amount in this case. My liver and wallet are very thankful I don't live close to HotD.",4.49
Matt,"Poured from fridge temp. Pours a murky brown. Nose is smoky malts, dark fruit (cherries, raspberries), and barrel. Taste follows the nose. Huge smoke presence on the taste. Very unexpected based on nose. Smoke dominates throughout. Get a coffee, vanilla, and bitter aftertaste. However, I taste smoke! Mouthfeel is good - I would characterize it as medium bodied.",4.35
Matt,"Deep caramel brown with no head. Maintains an oily film on top. Deep smell. Bourbon oak, tobacco, stone fruit. A very intense apple. Bourbon flambé. Some smokey fig. Candi sugar sweet. Smooth and tart. Some resiny stick. Just a great sipping beer.",4.6
Matt,"Long time want, thanks Barrythebear! 2010 Vintage (bottle) poured into a snifter.",4.7

Matt,2013 bottle enjoyed from snifter.,4.47
Matt,"Perhaps this style isn't exactly my thing, or the bottle was off, but i did not enjoy this. Very strong and overly sweet. Molten malt body with very little hop presence. Barrel notes overpowering.",3.18
Matt,"Tastes smokey, very little barrel present. It's like a baltic porter mixed with an old ale. Sweet and smokey, interesting to the point that I have few words to describe it, but it's an assault on the palate in a bad way as much as it is in a good way. Would not buy again for a while.",3.48
Matt,2010 bottle poured into a HotD branded tulip.,4.71
Matt,Absolutely stunning product. ,4.8
Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"Poured a black body with dark tan head that quickly died with minimal lace ring. Smell is basically chocolate and that's not a bad thing. Smooth, creamy, tastes like chocolate icing off the top of a cupcake with a milky slickness as well. ABV is well-hidden in this slightly bready/chewy beer that is basically heaven for anyone with a sweet tooth, but not cloying and enjoyable for anyone who just likes a good sweet stout.",4.2
Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,L - pours a used motor oil color. Looks viscous. Beautiful 2 fingure dark tan head that gives way to some tan lacing. ,4.57

Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"The beer pours Pitch Black with a medium khaki head. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of coconut, Swiss chocolate, caramel, and vanilla.

Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"Poured into a snifter. Jet black in color and viscous. It produced a medium-sized tan head which hung around for a while. A fairly potent aroma of milk chocolate, German chocolate cake, and spices. The taste was spot on. Silky-smooth chocolatey flavor with the spices described above. Impressively, this was not too sweet and seemed to have just the right feel. This is an amazing beer.",4.51

Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,Copenhagen Beer Fest Boston. This one was wacky. Smelled and tasted like double chocolate cake. Chocolate syrup. Pretty amazing especially if this was brewed using minimal flavoring.,4.5
Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"Pours an inky black with a head that quickly dissipates. Nose is consistent with a chocolate cupcake - baker's chocolate and frosting. Taste is spectacular! Just like a boozy chocolate cupcake. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a carbonation just shy of still. Overall, really quite tasty. This beer would be top notch if it had a little more body.",4.31

Gueuze 100% Lambic,"Had this on tap at Seymour in Greenfield. The beer had a bright, orange-yellow appearance with a thin head. The beer had a mixture of aromas of cherries, white wine, grapes that was wonderfully balanced. The taste had those aromas but it included an apple tartness. Very well carbonated and crisp. Overall, an excellent beer, especially with its aromas and flavors.",4.28

Gueuze 100% Lambic,"2013 variant, somewhat gentle but down the middle pour yields an almost opaque glowing gold beer topped off with a thin ring of bright white head that quickly recedes. Just beautiful. Nose is tart, fruity, and funky. Palate builds upon this with a robust a complex fruity character - getting some lemon, orange, and grapefruit peel. This is definitely a strong funky and sour quality as well, grassy, oaky, dry, farmhouse notes of earth and hay, slight spice to it and a wine like quality. All of the flavors so smooth and perfectly intergrated. Beautifully light and slightly effervescent mouthfeel. Perfect beer.",4.71
Gueuze 100% Lambic,"Pours a deep gold coloration with a tiny, quickly dissipating, fizzy head. Smell is quite funky, with notes of white grape, citrus, hay and a hint of blue cheese. Taste is quite dry, tart and funky, with earthy, musty woody barnyard notes, citrus zest and green apple at the forefront and lighter notes of hay, blue cheese and white grape. Finishes with a dry tartness and a good dose of funk lingering in the aftertaste. Sparkling, effervescent mouthfeel with a medium body and lively carbonation. Really well-balanced Geuze with a light sweetness, strong dryness, moderate tartness and strong funky notes. Quite drinkable, but with a certain complexity.

Gueuze 100% Lambic,Before I get into this I'm just gonna say it: This is one of the biggest disappointments I've ever experienced in my beering life.,3.9
Gueuze 100% Lambic,"2016, pours a light golden straw yellow with notes of pink and orange. Translucent in appearance with a thin foam head that dissipates quickly. Nose is of light funk, lemon zest a musty oak. Taste of tart lemon and citrus peel that give way to a slight bit of funk, a bit of that burlap sack stored in a barn for 50 years funk if you know what I mean ;) Smooth oak rounds out this one perfectly. Tartness was definitely the star here but I wouldn’t say the beer was overly tart or sour. It had the perfect amount of balance. Medium to light on body with moderate carbonation. Very dry clean finish to it.",4.46
Gueuze 100% Lambic,Bottle share.,4.38
Gueuze 100% Lambic,"Darker golden pour, smaller head. Barnyard, earth, funk, yeast, lemon in the aroma. Funky up front, citrus notes, earthy, barnyard, horseblanket, light wood. Medium to lighter body.",4.46
Gueuze 100% Lambic,Bottled on 3/29/17,4.59
Gueuze 100% Lambic,"750ml bottle. 1/18/17 bottle date. Appearance: Clear golden color with a pillowy white head and decent lacing Aroma: Strong funky brettanomyces character up front, lead by hay and horse blanket. A touch off grass, then the acidity pops up in the background, with apple cider vinegar notes. Taste: Starts with a light crackery malt sweetness before a bracing acidic tartness and bitterness, lemon peel, and light brett funk. Bready maltiness and brett notes emerge retronasally. Even some blue cheese Mouthfeel: Fairly light bodied with a high carbonation Finish: Dry and surprisingly bitter, with a lingering acidic lemon tartness. Funky blue cheese is there retronasally. Overall: An amazingly complex beer. Brettanomyces dominates the aroma, and the flavor profile shows off the bracingly tart acidity. A surprising amount of bitterness here and the lemon peel like acidic bitterness/tartness counterbalances throughout. Very crisp",4.26
Gueuze 100% Lambic,"i am not a sour fan, which is probably why I can not appreciate this but it is just not for me. super light in look and feel, yet it tastes like I am sucking on a lemon.",2.67
Gueuze 100% Lambic,"I have been scouring through my backlog, including some (mostly) bottles in my Beerfrigerator, an all-reefer with no freezer space. I had filled it at my parents' place, kind of ignored it, emptied it for the move to Chez Woody & then refilled it upon arrival. This one is going to be amazing! I pulled the cork & it is dated 1996.",4.32
Gueuze 100% Lambic,375ml bottled 17 May 2016,4.93
Temptation,"Effervescent gold, fluffy cap that settles into a persistent lace. Aroma has soft lemon peel, hibiscus, light loam, wet oak. Palate is features Brett tart upfront, more lacto sourness towards the back, distinct chardonnay note that really sets it apart. Undertones of oak, dry farmhouse yeast, citrus. Very good, maybe a smidge too lactic but love the chardonnay notes.",4.49
Temptation,"Bottle. 5/1/18 bottle date. Appearance: Crystal clear, golden, with a low lying white head. ",4.35
Temptation,2016 version poured into a snifter. A hazy golden color with a medium white head. Aroma was tart fruit. The taste followed but with a complex Bretty note. Overall a delicious blonde ale. Slightly tart and with complex phenolic notes. Outstanding.,4.43
Temptation,"Pours a clear straw color, minimal head. Funky aroma with apricot, lemon, oak, and Chardonnay. Even tastes like a Chardonnay! Has a saison beer mouthfeel - funky, tart, sour, micro carbonation. Overall an outstanding beer.",4.54
Temptation,"12-4-18 - I’ve had this one many times before, but never on my bride’s 55th birthday. 5/1/18 bottle date in the RRBC caged and corked bottle. Yes, I poured slowly into my RRBC tulip glass and left just a bit in the bottle.",4.46
Temptation,"Yellow pour - great mouthfeel and amazing smell / lemons, citrus. Phenomenal Saison feel to this beer. Reminds me a bit of a dry Chardonnay wine. One of the best!",4.56
Temptation,"[Original rating 2015-01-01] Sours are not my favorite style, and I’m certainly no expert on them but this one is pretty damn good. Smells like a chardonnay and the first sip tastes like it too, but then you get the sour with the wine. Nice fine carbonation, good mouth feel.",4.17
Temptation,"Bright hazy yellow beer with low white bubbles. Smell of white wine grapes and some lemon acid. Taste betrays the 7.5% abv. It is light and tart and delicate with just a bit of bread to balance out the citrus. An undertone of saturated wet oak fills in where the malt usually is balancing the tartness of limes, lemons, white pear and of course sour white wine grapes. Balance is impecable; beer went down disappointingly fast. Finishes dry and salty. Overall very delicious, but not going to come back too soon considering the 15 dollar price point.",4.21
Temptation,05/2017 edition poured at Toronado S.D. Pours a super clear straw color with no lacing and soda-like carbonation. ,4.43
Temptation,"Pours a bright golden yellow, semi hazy with a billowy bright white head. Nose is wine like. Grape must, grains and fresh sawed wood (oak) Taste of grape skins up front. Tartness comes through in the form of the skins. Some light lemon zest, grasses and grains follow. A smooth oak wine barrel finish to it. Much like a white wine. Mouthfeel is medium to light at times. This beer finishes very dry and I mean very! It leaves you definitely searching for the next sip. Drank this at 10 months from bottle date. Have another one I am letting go a few years and I will report back.",4.44
Temptation,"Look: Pale yellow body, 1 finger white head. ",4.38
Temptation,"A careful pour yields a slightly hazy gold with a two-finger pure white, dense and creamy head that persists and produces sheets of lace.",4.41
Temptation,"2015 Bottle, taster flight at Wades Wines in Westlake, CA.",4.28
Temptation,Bottle Date: 5/6/16,4.36
Temptation,"Tasted from draft. Pours a very pale light yellow. Clear with some lacing. Aroma is Brett, lemon, citrus, funk. Taste is pretty bitter with flavors of citrus, sour funk, grass and herbal notes. I'll admit I'm not a sour fan but this is well done.",3.57
Temptation,Shimmering clear gold with a moderate white foam that settles with good retention as a fluffy pillow leaving tall walls of cling. Temptation achieves level 10: infinite revival.,4.13
Temptation,"Poured into a Pint Defiance tulip. The body is a golden yellow with a thin head. Aromas include lemon, brett, baked bread, and oak barrels. Flavors are the same. The feel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, and is dry.",4.69
Temptation,"Caged and corked bottle poured into a stein, some lacings ",4.25
Temptation,In review is a 2012 vintage.,4.11
Temptation,Straw cloudy appearance with one finger white head that desipates quickly. Strong citrus aroma with a hint of sour apple. Plenty of carbination with sour apple and citrus flavor. Fairly dry.,4.46
Temptation,"I was lucky enough to score a bunch of bottles when I Was on vacation in the bay area in the summer of 2017. I stopped in, bought the bottles and got out. A beer like this would have been at least an hour wait in New England!",5
Temptation,"A careful pour yields a clear yellow color with a fluffy white head. The head has great staying power and leaves wonderful lacing. The nose is funk, citrus, white wine and a touch of graininess. The taste is raw grains and lemon up front, followed by white wine, funk and a drying oak. The sourness doesn't overpower things here, but is obviously present. The mouthfeel is very dry, yet with good body. Overall, it's a good sour that stands the test of time. The complexities I'm looking for are all present, but some are in greater aspects than desired. Still something I'll never say no to.",4.24
Temptation,"Pale straw colored,but it is mostly cloudy in complexion. There's a fingernail of eggshell white around the rim and the vast majority of the top. The aroma is packed with chardonnay, oak, and lactic acid. I'm tasting mostly tart pear and then the brettanomyces kicks in during the fade and comes off bitter and tart. This is moderately carbonated,but oddly smooth for a wild ale.",4.3
Temptation,bottled 5-6-16; poured into a tulip,4.25
Temptation,Great sour beer aged in chardonnay barrels. Nice golden color and the best funk smell going on a Russian River sour. The oak notes are perfect and note over powering and taste amazing. Best Russian River sour.,4.67
BDCS,"12oz can labeled 2019 poured into a Spiegelau stout glass at fridge temp 10.3% ABV. The beer pours dense oily black with strong mocha head on hard pour. The head recedes to a half inch cap and leaves some lacing. The aroma is immediately noticeable after the pour with elements of chocolate, vanilla, oak and bourbon. The taste is semisweet caramel and roasted malt with coffee, vanilla, chocolate, oak and bourbon all popping through mid palate before a moderately bitter finish. The mouthfeel is full to medium bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. No sign of the ABV in the taste or aroma. Very balanced and not cloying, yet luxuriously rich. Overall, outstanding. Thank you @russpowell!",4.59
BDCS,"Not the darkest pour in the world, but sits opaque black in the glass, with a super dense, mocha head. Smells like a freshly emptied bourbon barrel, which means a lot of the actual “beer” smell is overpowered. However, the flavors are much more balanced, and it’s scarily drinkable for over 10%. Like drinking a mountain of baker’s chocolate brownie batter. Bittersweet, vanilla, roasted coffee. Smooth as silk. Great stuff.",4.27
BDCS,2017 version poured from a 12 oz. can at home. Thanks for the trade Jon! Bourbon and chocolate. Like a bourbon soaked brownie. Exceeded my expectations.,4.75
BDCS,"Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is roasty, toasty, nutty, caramely malts with chocolate, caramel, vanilla, oak and coffee just beyond. It has a sweet onset, and then fades slightly towards bitter. Bourbon adds a kiss of heat on the back of the nose, but is far from over powering. Flavor profile is deep and expressive, hitting notes of caramel, vanilla, oak, chocolate, toffee, and bourbon. Roasty, toasty, caramely malts add a firm foundation for the sugary notes. Dark and expressive. Mouth feel is thick with a velvety, creamy texture that carries just a touch of grittiness. Overall, dark and expressive, and yet far from overly complex or mind numbing. ",4.6
BDCS,"Good afternoon, NBS! Some yard work and additional gardening done this morning and now moving onto this one courtesy of ",4.61
BDCS,"Uhm, yum. Bourbon up front, bourbon in the nose, with a sweet, not cloying, aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full. Not warming, don’t taste the alcohol, but wow does it smack you in the head! I might revise my rating later when I’m not so smashed!",4.61
BDCS,"Given to me by @jvgoor3786, and damn, am I glad for that! This is a real great beer. To quote Monty Python, black as the ace of spades, he was, with slightly brownish/purple thinning edges. Had half a fingertip of quickly dissipating head that left a minimal amount of lacing. Smell is a balanced mixture of bourbon barrel, chocolate, and malt. Well, maybe the barrel is more prevalent than the other two. On taste, however, it’s a lot more balanced between the three, with a little bit of vanilla and a bit of a fruity red wine note in there for good measure. Everything comes together-it’s sweet, roasty, and has a tangy, woodsy burn from the barrel. Feel is maybe where this outstanding beer is most outstanding. It’s big and bold from the barrel, but there’s some subtle silky smoothness from the malt and sweet adjuncts. Mouth watering and a healthy alcohol presence. The only thing I can say about it being ranked in the top 250 beers is that 172 may be too low. Thanks tons for sending me this one, Jason, and thanks to Ozark Beer Company for an awesome beer.",4.99
BDCS,"Heavy chocolate in the nose. Lighter in the taste with a fair amount of boozyness. That taste is not overtaken by the alcohol, but has a slight boozy feel on the tongue. The chocolate was subtle but tasty. Heavy but wonderful for the 12 ounce size can!",4.34
BDCS,"From can. Very dark brown-black color with a good bit of lacing foam upon pour which stuck around as you drank. Deep dark and boozy aroma. Chocolate, coffee, roasty and malty. Softer, medium-thick mouthfeel. Reminds good bit of BA Ten Fidy.",4.32
BDCS,"Poured into a snifter. Opaque dark chocolate color with a thin tan head. Aroma was chocolate with roasted grain and coffee. Taste was chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, and vanilla. Excellent beer.",4.15
BDCS,L - 1/2 finger dense mocha head atop a motor oil body.,4.47
BDCS,Received in a trade and shared with JLindros. 2018 vintage.,3.83
BDCS,Thanks to rudzud,3.86
BDCS,2018 can. Thanks Russ.,4.88
BDCS,"Pours like motor oil. Thick pouring, pitch black. 1 finger tan head, and the retention is amazing. There's some lacing on the glass. ",4.72
BDCS,"Black and thick with a thin khaki head that disappears completely. A dominating smell of brownie batter with a hint of bourbon. Thick, deep, dark, decadent chocolate with a hint of roasted malt. Subtle bourbon and vanilla accents on the finish. World class!",4.69
BDCS,The velvety chocolate and smooth bourbon on the nose and taste are reminiscent of a tootsie roll or double fudge brownies. The mouthfeel is thinner than it appears in the glass and is really the only slight negative. Overall a solid stout I would enjoy over and over again.,4.58
BDCS,"Viscous used motor oil black with a slow to build, super thick soft mocha head that retains well, settling to a thick blanket leaving spotty waves of lace.",4.18
BDCS,2018 can.,4.53
BDCS,Long time want. Traded a bottle of scotch for a 4 pack making this a ~$30 can after shipping. ,4.14
BDCS,2018 vintage (first time canned).,4.48
BDCS,A huge hug out to scarysun for this minimalist silver 12 oz. can (2017). I’ve put up more ISO posts for this bastard than any beer I’ve ever hunted. And it’s here. I’m going to put on some Wang Chung & do a happy dance. ,4.28
BDCS,Received in a trade with @gibgink – thanks Dennis!,3.91
BDCS,"this is one of those beers of lore ive heard a lot about but thought i might never get the chance to try. thanks to my new homie who brought one out, my fantasy has become reality. i think its rare for beer to live up to crazy hype these days, so many competent producers out there and so much variation on cool themes, theres good beer everywhere and one thats surprisingly good is hard to really find anymore because the quality standard has come up so much across the industry. this definitely did take me by surprise though. shiny obsidian black from the can with a single finger of mocha foam and a huge nose of vanilla bean, sarsaparilla, and brownie batter. its thick for sure in the nose, dense, a lot to unpack. i get char too, lots of it, which introduces the barrel elements really nicely, more vanilla, sweet whiskey, and baking chocolate. the flavor is equally excellent, even more layered, with a lot of chocolate and vanilla to it, almost hard to believe it isnt loaded with adjuncts and that all of this can come from grain and barrel. i get more of the root beer thing, vanilla and like actual roots, a product of the oak im sure, but its awesome. heavy deep dark chocolate, high cacao, the good stuff, cant believe none is actually in here. one thing i love about this is how its still really bitter from the dark barley all the way through, and how it never gets too sweet. so many of these dont taste like stout anymore, and can be diabetic on the residual sugar, but this one actually finishes which is awesome. huge sturdy body, not too boozy even when it warms up, and slick and slippery going down. 2017 vintage drinking awesome right now, huge thanks to my new homie for bringing this one out, it definitely lives up to the hype!",4.38
BDCS,"Extremely pleased with BDCS - it was a bit of a precious trade, so my hopes were high. I had just the one 12oz can to share with six or seven friends, so while the pours were small, we all agreed that the chocolate and bourbon notes make this an exceptional beer. I wish it were more easily procured!",4.75
Citraquench'l,Poured from a tallboy can into a Dogfish Head tulip,4.5
Citraquench'l,"Amazing. This was my introduction into IPA's, and now I am hooked! I absolutely recommend this beer to everyone who is in Charlotte and loves good beer. All of Heist Brewery's brews are amazing though!! For sure one to check out!",5
Citraquench'l,Canned fall 2016; drank 10/15/16 @ the Palace. ,3.98
Citraquench'l,Bought a crowler if this when I was in NC for a house hunting trip. Moving from CT I was anxious to try the best NC had to offer. It’s almost as good as any NE IPA from the classic stops. Well done Heist!,4.5
Citraquench'l,Thanks goes out to russpowell for this brew.,4.37
Citraquench'l,"Enjoyed on draft at Smoke and Barrell bbq joint. Juicy, creamy, smooth...enter any adjective here and it applies! Throughly enjoyed this even though smoky bbq might not be the best pairing!",4.71
Citraquench'l,A: The beer is cloudy yellow in color and poured with a short white head that left lots of wisps of lacing on the surface and a narrow collar around the edge of the glass.,4.4
Citraquench'l,L - massive head atop a glowing orange body.,4.31
Citraquench'l,"I unfortunately can't get down with 100% Citra IPAs much anymore (with the exception of Double Citra from HF - drool) - the overpowering qualities of cat pee dominate here; good to try though, and a great body for what it is.",4.22
Citraquench'l,From the tap: ,4.67
Citraquench'l,Thanks to Mr. Beer_Economicus for this Charlotte beauty.,3.99
Citraquench'l,"On tap at the brewery. Get there EARLY to get a park. My favorite draft IPA to date, smooth and power-flavors with excellent finish. Great staff at Heist let me sample others without asking. Highest recommendation! Also got some 16 oz cans for my homeboys as I live 259 miles away",4.97
Citraquench'l,"Canned 07/06/18, so 10 days ago.",4.29
Citraquench'l,"Crowler, shared with friends on 5/26 - Citraquench'l pours a light, attractive yellow-orange. It looks a bit like Tang, actually, plus carb! It smells fantastic - sweet and full of citrus.",4.58
Citraquench'l,Poured from a three hour old crowler. ,4.85
Citraquench'l,On tap at Southern Grist. Bright yellow haze with a fluffy white head. Huge Citra aroma. All citrus and berries with no catty notes. The taste stood up to the nose. Great and bright citrus Notes with a faint underlying dankness. Bready malt. Just outstanding.,4.46
Citraquench'l,"A pale, murky, juicy looking beer with a nice light and sticky head. The nose is full of grapefruit, papaya, a tiny bit of green onion and pine. Sweet caramel, bitter citrus pith, grapefruit and pine. Finishes dry with a big pine aftertaste. Very good beer.",4.59
Citraquench'l,"Pours hazy orangeish yellow. Foamy, tall white head that lasts A while with good lacing.",4.47
Citraquench'l,"Pours a turbid, peach-flesh like color with two and half fingers of white foamy head. Head forms eagerly even out of an 8 day old crowler. Lovely lacing left behind as well. Splendid start to the drinking experience. Aroma is tropical fruits - specifically, papaya, mango, and pineapple with a sweet marmalade note in the back. On the hop spectrum of bitter to sugary sweet, this lands at about a 60% sweet. Not overly so, but just enough to welcome a sip. Flavor profile oozes papaya, mango, pineapple, sweet marmalade, and peaches. Yeast is present, but just barely so, with a dash of biscuit malts in the back. The soft, slightly grainy, calcium-like feeling keeps this beer drinking smooth delivering those wonderful hop notes. It has a medium thickness that fills out the palate well without drinking like a meal. Overall, a sublime NE IPA. Loads of hop notes that remain well balanced. It is a touch sweet, but isn't overly so. ",4.55
Citraquench'l,"L: cloudy, yellow orange, nice lacing, looks like a milkshake ",4.09
Citraquench'l,Hazy straw color with a slighly white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a grapefruit and slight hops that is very pleasant. Taste is also a grapefruit and slight hops that is very appealing.,4.48
Citraquench'l,Poured from a 16oz can into a nonic pint glass. ,4.63
Citraquench'l,"This is easily one of the best, most surprising IPAs I've come across in a while. Had this while I was in Charlotte and it was easily the best beer I had on my trip. Not to knock the rest of their beer, but this was by far their standout. I had it on tap and from a crowler a couple days later and it was just fantastic. Locally, it reminds me a lot of what Triple Crossing does in Richmond, but it was just better all around. Absolutely fantastic beer I hope they start making more readily available so I can trade for it. It's worth it.",4.82
Citraquench'l,Appearance - Pours bright orange hazy with thick fluffy white head that lasts forever. Lots of stringy lacing all over the glass.,5
Citraquench'l,Fantastic IPA. Crowler filled on 3/3. Hazy/murky orange in appearance. So tropical on the nose and flavor. Just super delicious. Really glad to have tracked this down. Excellent brew!,4.59
Barrel Aged Bomb!,A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer topped by a minuscule tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with no lacing,4.75
Barrel Aged Bomb!,Picked up a 12 oz bottle from the Craft Beer Hop Stop7-24-19 for $12.99. No bottling date visible. Consumed 10/7/19.,4.43
Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Good but not as good as Bomb. I wish there was more bourbon and the mouthfeel was thicker. Good flavors but a bit muted. Glad I got to try it but at this price point (9 bucks for the bottle), there are better choices.",4.06
Barrel Aged Bomb!,L: Dark dark black - no head to speak of,4.5
Barrel Aged Bomb!,"This is simply a fantastic BA stout!!! Bomb! is super well-balanced, but the barrel aging process seemed to really bring out the vanilla in the vintage we tried, which can be a bad thing if it's not good vanilla but this seemed like high quality stuff. Wish I had more",4.79
Barrel Aged Bomb!,It would be easier for me to talk about the things that I do not like about this beer.,5
Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Reviewed on 4/29/16, from notes",4.21
Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Great mouth feel. Nice smell of booze and chocolate. Pours a nice dark black, very viscous. Mouth feel is nice and smooth. Chile and vanilla comes through nicely at the end.",4.74
Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Interested and curious to try this again. Because I remember the first time having this (in 2016) noting that it muted the chili peppers and now with the 2017 and 2018 bomb! I have felt like the pepper quality has already been muted. And because it's only 11.2%? The regular is 13% and pirate bomb is 15%? What's the difference here? Let's see. Pouring from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. This beer pours out looking like dark chocolate in color and forms a very thin caramel crown that disippated before I even got a picture. The first thing I notice on the smell is a ton of dark fruit. Raisins and plums dance around while introducing you to some barrel notes in the form of a dry oak smell. Very good smell but I'm not getting too much from the nose in the way of the regular bomb! So we'll see what the tastes brings. From the first sip the chocolate kicks through the curtain and steals the floor, while the dark fruit are supporting from behind. As far as the chili peppers, it's about what I expected. You wouldn't even know they're in the beer. I wish the coffee and vanilla were showing up a little more as well, but I do have to say that this is greatly balanced as far as the whiskey and barrel being present but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is thick and fudge like. It coats the mouth all the way through while providing a slight and well balanced warming sensation. Overall, this was a very good treat and I'm glad to have another crack at it. But it's pretty much what I remember from the first time. It's very good, but not great. I've had better barrel aged beers and it does bother me that this one covers up all the flavors of the original. Kinda takes the point away to me, I guess. It's a solid treat nonetheless, but give me a regular Bomb! and I'll be good.",4.34
Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Smell: Initially I get a good amount of spicy green chillies. a lot of chocolate. Dark Chocolate, milk chocolate. You get some Barrel notes, Sweet vanilla, toasted coconut, smooth whiskey with a hint of oak. Also get some caramel and dark malts that come through as well. ",4.68
Barrel Aged Bomb!,Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Teku glass. ,4.34
Barrel Aged Bomb!,"From the bottle, it pours black as pitch as coal with virtually no head. Vanilla, bourbon and alcohol in the nose. The mouth gets the same and more flavors as well. Great flavor!",4.42
Barrel Aged Bomb!,Every sip tasted different. But every sip was phenomenal! Never guess this was 11.2 ABV! So smoothe. Caramel bites really make it. Bourbon not too strong. The hint of vanilla. I'm in love!,4.65
Barrel Aged Bomb!,Very dark appearance with minimal tan head. Aroma is a nice slightly sweet caramel with a touch of spice. Taste is also a slightly sweet caramel with a little spicy heat.,4.52
Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Bomb is an acquired taste for me, but the BA version is dynamite. It mellows out the heat from the peppers and adds a smooth barrel finish. This is really a solid beer.",4.23
Barrel Aged Bomb!,Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass.,4.46
Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Poured into a snifter. Like most other big Prairie stouts, a black pour with a minimal tan head which fades to a ring. There is a pretty strong aroma- the Ancho chiles jump out at me, but chocolate and whiskey are there in the background. The taste is complex: there is a hint of coffee present, but whiskey and chocolate are most prominent, with caramel malt, vanilla, oak notes, and a touch of cinnamon following. The whiskey is extremely well-melded with the rest of the beer, and is present mid-palate through the finish. The chiles are somewhat muted, compared to the standard Bomb!, but provide a nice warming heat at the finish. The beer is full bodied, incredibly smooth the entire way through, and a touch boozy on the finish. Pretty incredible. Huge fan of Prairie's stouts, but this one surpassed my expectations and blew me away.",4.82
Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Viscous and opaque dark brown out of the glass. Prominent chiles and spices on the nose, with faint whiskey and cocoa. Not much coffee. The taste followed closely. Very similar to Bomb! but with an added dimension with the whiskey barrel. To their credit, this did not overwhelm the beer. Full-bodied and smooth on the finish. A nice improvement (hard to believe) to the base beer.",4.46
Barrel Aged Bomb!,L: very usual jet black prairie stouts. No head. ,4.75
Barrel Aged Bomb!,Bottle:,4.24
Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Pours pitch black, no head and thick lacing on the glass. ",4.3
Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Deep black but not as thick on the pour as I remember. Similarly, the nose has more chile heat than I recall. The palate threatens palate-wrecking spice at the outset, but it is beautifully cut by the bourbon. The pairing of sweet bourbon with hot chile works magically. This is, unquestionably, the best chile imperial stout I've tried to date. The chile's cutting of the bourbon also brings out the chocolate undertones of the base beer - tastes strikingly similar to Taza Cacao Crunch Stone Ground chocolate - the interplay of spice and dark chocolate is outstanding. Medium thick.",4.32

Black & Wild,"Not anything I want to try again, just not my cup of tea and if you put any other label on this beer besides ""side Project"" it would fall into the Tart of Darkness category. Happy to tick but nothing to write home about. sorry bruh",3.44
Black & Wild,"8oz pour on draft at the brewery tasting room. looks dark maroon to dark brown with tan swirls. smells of sharp acidity, bourbon soaked cherries with a little drizzle of chocolate. taste is very light bourbon, rich acidity, sour cherries and chocolate maltiness. feel is full and somewhat more carbonated than expected but nothing to complain about. overall, the intense sourness is balanced quite well by the maltiness and chocolate flavors. such a unique beer. very glad to have finally tried this.",4.66
Black & Wild,"Was surprised that I got to try this beer. Batch 1, shared at the SP Brewery 1 year anniversary. Pours a dark reddish hue, with not a ton of carb. I didn't pick up on much more than the cherry on the nose. Flavor was pretty intense, which was a bit of a surprise given the age of the bottle. A nice robust tart cherry flavor on the palate. I didn't get a lot of the barrel, but that could've been from all the other insane beers I was having at the time.",4.38
Black & Wild,"One of the most unique wild's I've ever had. It is black, and it is wildly acidic and flavor packed. Flavor had a lot of oak, molasses, raisin, chocolate, sour cherry, and spice, and a perfect bourbon balance without being boozy ... didn't detect the vanilla. The nose follows the palate with the sour cherry really coming through, and the vanilla making its appearance. The mouth feel is what really stands out with this beer, amazingly thick syrupy smooth and long lasting with flavor on the finish. Amazing wild, amazingly unique! Must try!",4.74
Black & Wild,Pours opaque brown with a small thin champagne like head. Has a chocolate type sour smell. Taste is incredibly well balance. Definitely get the chocolate and the cherry mid palate and finishes with a sour cherry finish. Well done.,4.77
Black & Wild,L: Dark mahogany and amber hues with a thin khaki head,4.8
Black & Wild,"I thought this was really interesting. Chocolate, bourbon flavor comes through, and ends sour. Think chocolate covered cherry dipped in bourbon. This was not overly sweet, but had a great balance. An exceptional beer that I haven't seen done before.",4.67
Black & Wild,probably the best dark sour I have ever had.,4.93
Black & Wild,Was lucky enough to have this one at the source! Enjoyed at Side Project Taproom with friends and this is one amazing Wild! Very complex and fruity!,4.65
Black & Wild,"Blend #2---poured into a HF Tulip glass,.... has some typical dark sour notes, cherry, chocolate, fig, all blending together... a fair amount of sourness, not enamel eating but definitely up there.... has a unique and long finish that differentiates it from other dark sours ive had... hard to qualify, almost chlorine-like but in a good way (sounds odd I know).... Very nice but not a huge edge over other more accessible dark sours.",4.29
Black & Wild,"Pours an inky black in the glass. Decent beige head. Smell is nuanced: roasted cocoa, vanilla, sour cherry, red grapes. Flavor is tarter than the nose suggests. Very vinous, fruit forward. Big, acidic finish but the chocolate malt backbone helps it along. The best kind of German chocolate cake.",4.49
Black & Wild,Black and dark in color. So much jam. Jammy goodness. Sour and tart and goodness. Black berries and raspberries. Very drinkable. I'd love to have more of this one.,4.41
Black & Wild,"Pours dark brown with reddish hue and one finger head. Aroma is cherries, blackberries, some chocolate, vinegar, and oak. Taste is an explosion of dark berries and cherry skins. Tastes super tart and acidic like cherry and BlackBerry skins. Chocolate isn't prominent but adds complexity. I get hints of citrus and vanilla as it warms. Mouth feel is medium to full. Tart berries dominate here. The oak provides character and and dry finish. Unique and complex beer.",4.57
Black & Wild,"750 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Black body with a huge khaki head. Nice looking. I immediately smell bourbon. Strong acidity and roasted malt. Maybe cherries? Taste is much stronger cherry. Intensely sour. Overpowers everything. Some roasted malt and a little bitterness, but mostly sourness. Well carbonated. Medium body. Flavorful, but overwhelmed by sourness. I get none of the barrel in the taste, though.",4.22
Black & Wild,750ml consumed at Side Project.,4.57
Black & Wild,Appearance: Pours the color of coffee capped by an inch or so of foam; some lacing action,4.37
Black & Wild,"Batch #2 from a 750 ml bottle at the Side Project Cellar. Black & Wild has one of the most complex flavor profiles of any beer I have ever had. Sourness, tart cherries, and vanilla and oak from the whiskey barrel are balanced perfectly. Just incredible.",4.96

Black & Wild,A - Dark muddled brown and red coloring with minimal small tan head that recedes back into the glass. Nice retention here.,4.99
Black & Wild,A- Pours dark brown with red tones around the edges and deep brown to black in the middle of the body. A small and bubbly head forms but doesn't stick around very long. Head is tan to light brown in color. Minimal lacing due to lack of head as you drink.,4.37
Black & Wild,A- Pours a murky dark brown/reddish color with a small tan head that recedes to a collar leaving some lacing.,4.76

Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,This has the look of motor oil ,4.31
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Poured from a can into pint glass in October 2019. There was a canned on date of 10/14/2018 @ 17:45, so the beer had aged about 1 year.",4.47
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Poured black at 53 degrees with a large mousse-like dark tan head; ruby edges; long cap retention; heavy ring and lacing; thin legs. Sweet caramel malt, bourbon, vanilla and oak nose. Bourbon entry with bittersweet dark chocolate right behind; toffee, oak, vanilla, bitter roast; not boozy. Medium body; smooth feel; moderate minus carbonation; minimal warmth from 12.9%; alcohol bite on tip of tongue. Overall, well balanced between sweet caramel/chocolate base, bitter roast, and barrel notes; pleasing bitter roast linger on the palate.",4.67
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Solid BBA RIS. The cellared stovepipe can I had was from 11/10/17, consumed on 8/20/19. Good bourbon on the nose, not really a whole lot else. Taste has much more going on, pick up the burnt sugar and caramel notes along the way. Just wish the feel was a tad bit thicker and creamier. Overall, I'd put it just behind Parabola for non-adjunct BBA RISs.",4.42
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,Looks super dark black with some low amounts of carbonation - head recedes but bubble activity is still decent - great for a barrel aged imperial stout,4.83
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"This is so damn good...Pitch black with a thin mocha head..good lace..I cant believe how good this is...Smells sweet with bourbon and roasty malt. Taste is out of this world..Might be the best Stout or maybe even the best BEER I've ever had..Body is like past due diesel motor oil...If it has bubbles, I cannot see them..This stuff is beer sex in a can.",4.67

Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,Appearance: Black with a generous-sized dark beige head that gradually faded. A good looking Imperial Stout,4.25
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"For some reason it has taken me a while to warm to Ten Fidy, though I am well aware of its high reputation. Well, this BA version has really brought me around - it’s a very fine beer indeed. Black as night right to the edges. Wonderful, rich boozy nose, redolent with nutty, dark honey malts, a tangle of complex whiskey notes and almost stinging vanilla extract. The taste really fires on all cylinders, with the subtle, elegant power of a Maserati. The super charged whiskey is amazingly well balanced by a super strong malt backbone that ranges from honey through black molasses to traces of charcoal, dry bitter chocolate and just a hint of dried cherries. I had to move my rating for the feel up a notch - it’s really finely crafted. I can no longer deny it, this is a world class beer.",4.49
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"First time with the BA version of my fave RIS. Obviously great in all categories. Velvety, robust with chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, roasty goodness, but the most pleasant surprise in the finish is a delicious almond note that goes on to infinity. Awesome!",4.73

Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Tremendous. Regular Ten Fidy is one of my favorite stouts, and this just ratchets every positive attribute to 11. ",4.63
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Canned on 10/13/18, pours out pitch black with zero light penetration. Poured aggressively it generates a modest amount of dark tan head, which subsides rather quickly. Smell is bold but balanced, roasted malts and slick bourbon aroma. I pick up tastes of bourbon, malts, with smaller bits of licorice and a curious tobacco note. Feel is nigh perfect, chewy and silky smooth as it finishes, no alcohol burn detectable whatsoever. It goes without saying that this is an exceptional beer, standing head and shoulders above it's very stiff competition.",4.64

Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Pours pitch black, impervious to light, nice mocha head. Big chocolate aroma, bourbon barrel, faint yeast. Big chocolate flavor, fudge,lots of barrel flavor, big bitter espresso finish that lingers.overall, very good BA beer. Drank 2017 & 2018 vertical. I liked the 2017 much more than the 2018, much more chocolaty.",4.44
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"A deep, dark, rich barrel-aged imperial stout that took the best elements of Oskar Blues' Ten FIDY and made it even better! Pours a very dark black color, rich and thick and viscous, with a little tan head and spotty lingering lacing. Smells of bourbon, oak, dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, stone fruit, malt and caramel. Tastes similarly, along with some vanilla, roasted nuttiness, raisin, brown sugar and molasses. Smooth, sticky, viscous mouthfeel that was perhaps a touch creamy and good carbonation. Very impressive beer and definitely one to sip - though the ABV is high the warming alcohol doesn't hit you as hard until the beer warms closer to room temperature.",4.19

Mother Of All Storms,"2018 bottle. Pours black with a large light brown head that settles to a ring and leaves minimal lacing. Smells of oak, vanilla, bourbon and dark fruits. Tastes of bourbon, vanilla, oak, caramel, figs, dates, toffee,raisin and a hint of chocolate. Full bodied. light carbonation, plush mouth feel, bourbon lingers on the finish along with mild dryness.",4.5
Mother Of All Storms,"2011 bottle poured into a snifter. A hazy medium brown color with a thin tan head. Aroma was whiskey barrel up front followed by sweet caramel, toffee, and faint stone fruit. The taste followed thankfully. A rich, smooth experience of caramel and toffee malt balanced by plum and prune notes, framed by a restrained barrel presence. Full bodied and just rounded. A bit oxidized but this did not detract. Phenomenal.",4.53
Mother Of All Storms,"Garnet-tinted dark brown with a half finger of short-lived tan head that quickly settles into a nice, soupy crown.",4.4
Mother Of All Storms,"absolutely wonderful beer and one off of the long time wants list for me, who would have guessed it would take moving to idaho to find one?! in any event, its worth the hype and the years of frothing for one, a decadent barleywine experience with lots of barrel character, a ton of malt richness and layering, but not as over the top heavy and sweet as some of these can be, as it has a great maturity, lots of wood, some tannins from the oak, and enough barrel char and booze to keep it from being diabetic. pretty deep amber color with some head from the bottle, dense but not sedimented, and high shine in the right light. aroma is awesome, slight oxidation over sweet concentrated grain sugars, molasses and maple notes, some soy sauce, high end bourbon, vanilla, burnt wood, toffee, creme brulee, and a fruity mix of dried apple, raisin, and holiday fruitcake. the enormous alcohol content makes no effort to conceal itself either. the flavor has a ton going on too, sweet dates and molasses, a little more of the soy thing, lots of woody maturity and a ton of whiskey, vanilla and honey notes from it, some bitter char thats needed for balance here, and a whole ton of booze, but its warming me from the inside out in the most pleasant way. this is a monster, even if the body isnt as big as some of them, its a slow sipper and one to cherish and savor. i see why this has become sort of a cult following beer, its a prime example of the style and is wonderfully barrel aged. worth every penny!",4.26
Mother Of All Storms,Look: Pitch black. One finger of tan head that quickly dissipates.,3.95
Mother Of All Storms,"2018-11 bomber opened slightly chilled. Poured hard to a tulip, which after tasting, should really be a chalice. Aroma of vanilla and caramel can be smelled two feet from the glass! Color is mahogany / chestnut brown, with a two-finger tan head that burns down to a tiny ring with scant lacing. First sips are full of vanilla, caramel, oak barrel, malty barley. The bourbon is very subtle but stays present for awhile. As it warms, there’s a bit more bourbon bite up front and darker malt on the back...not cocoa type of malt. Slightly warming. Mouthfeel is medium, perhaps a little thinner than Id like, but overall very nice. Five more on a shelf, so we’ll see how time affects them. BWIL!",4.54
Mother Of All Storms,2012: A little smokiness. Malty and sweet. Super good.,4.33
Mother Of All Storms,"Appearance: This beer pours an opaque black with burnt sienna around the edges when held up to the light. A light brown, two finger, fluffy head with tightly packed bubbles nearly disappears with a thin ring around the edge of the glass. No lacing on my snifter as I drink the beer. ",4.6
Mother Of All Storms,"Pours a deep brown into the glass, and therein appears essentially black save for the translucent brown edges... A finger of creamy tan foam on top relaxes into a flimsy collar shortly after the pour... Aromas suggest bourbon-soaked dark fruits like plum, prune, raisin, and fig... On the sip, similar fruity impressions blossom, with a rich malt base and flavor elements of molasses and fruit breads drenched with booze... The feel is full, round and soft, with a little bit of chewy fruit under a light air of vanilla and dark whiskey... ",4.71

Mother Of All Storms,"2014 vintage, thanks T! From a 22 oz bottle, pours an almost impenetrable deep amber. Small mocha-colored head looks very appetizing.

Leche Borracho,A 2018 release packaged in a 500ml bottle.,4.45
Leche Borracho,Tasted from 2018 bottle. Pours black with faint light brown head. Aroma of peppers and cinnamon. Flavor is moderately sweet. Nice pepper flavor with chocolate and cinnamon. Just a faint hint of tequila that I wouldn’t have picked up without knowing. Some caramel and bourbon notes. Complex and extremely well done.,4.69
Leche Borracho,"Poured from fridge temp. Pours motor oil black with quickly dissipating brown head. Nose is amazing. Spicy peppers, bourbon, tequila, molasses, cherries, chocolate, lactose, and a touch of wood. Taste is insane. Peppery spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, tequila, bourbon, brown sugar, blackberries, cherries, chocolate milk. It's definitely sweet, but not overpowering at all. The aftertaste is really nice - a touch of spice and bourbon. Mouthfeel is super creamy and robust. Overall, an amazing BA stout.",4.74

Leche Borracho,On tap at the source. 2018 edition.,4.5
Leche Borracho,"Batch 2 (2018), poured from the bottle into an FO b3 glass. Pours a rich chocolate fudge with next to no carbonation. Nose is pepper, cinnamon, sugar, and chocolate fudge, with both tequila and bourbon barrel characteristics coming through but not dominating. Palate is full of fudge, spicy pepper, cinnamon, and sugar. As a big non-fan of tequila-barrel beers, I'm happy to report that the barrel plays well with the rest of the beer, and overall the flavors integrate better than I expected they would. This is probably my third-ranked tequila barrel beer, with PNC and Leche b1 being the top two.",4.48
Leche Borracho,"On tap at the brewery. Al lot going on with this one, but the flavors really played well together. A spicy aroma with cinnamon, peppers, and subtle tequila. They were all there on the palate but joined by bourbon and chocolate. There was a nuttiness from the combination. Nothing was overdone and each sip allowed a fun exploration of the flavors. Big hefty feel to support all of this. Outstanding.",4.59
Leche Borracho,Had a taster at the brewery. Poured very dark with a sweet aroma of vanilla and spice and just a hint of chile. The flavor is extremely well balanced. The bourbon barrel and vanilla provide a sweetness that is well complimented with cinnamon and a bit of chile heat and flavor. The tequila barrel shows up in just the right amount on the finish.,4.42

Leche Borracho,Poured from a 500mL bottle into a bottle logic snifter. Acquired in a trade. ,4.62
Leche Borracho,Great spicy brew. Good mixture of barrel and heat. Thought this was one of the best BA spiced beers I've ever had up there with BA cake and BA oro negro. Really impressed how bottle logic's descriptions are always on point.,4.56
Leche Borracho,"Rich vanilla nose, chocolate, slight booziness to it. Big dark chocolate and cinnamon on the tongue, finishes with a slight kick. Definitely a well layered balanced beer, however I would have preferred a slightly higher bourbon profile on the nose and taste.",4.66
Leche Borracho,"Unfortunately, I rushed this taste a bit. Dark pour with a little tan head to it, this beer had a nice cinnamon backbone which ran from front to back, with the peppers adding some grip and texture. Well-structured and put together.",4.44
Leche Borracho,"Whether its a rich stout or an alcoholic malty, the line between dark ale and milkshake is a complete blur when the Bottle Logic gets ridiculous with their imperial stouts. Bourbon and tequila barrels, chilies and spice, sugars and chocolates- the entire brewer's pantry is on call with this massive beer.",4.56
Leche Borracho,"Super creamy and thick, great mouth feel, peppers and sugar comes thru more prominently than other ingredients, more bourbon barrel flavor with a hint of the tequila. Overall very solid beer from bottle logic.",4.51
Leche Borracho,"L: Deep black, with a tan head.",4.52
Leche Borracho,"There's a lot going on in this beer. Not only do we have the traditional Mexican chocolate treatment, but there's tequila barrels and lactose sugar thrown in as well. I was worried at first when this bottle gushed a little and looked weird in the glass. There were just a few large bubbles on the surface of the beer popping aggressively until they left without a trace. It also takes a minute for the aroma to develop, but when it does the boozy exterior gives way to inviting notes of cinnamon and dark fruit. Those dark fruits are a welcomed feature of this beer adding complexity on the aroma and taste. I think they're able to come through because the chocolate is not as forward as some other stouts in this style. I get some milk sugar and lots of vanilla in the flavor, but the texture isn't as creamy as you'd expect from a milk stout. The tequila provides a burn going down. When combined with the heat from the peppers and the spritzy carbonation, this beer seemed slightly off balance in stark contrast wit hthe other BL beer I've tried, Ground State. The mouth feel is adequate, but nothing special. The highlight of this beer is the excellent flavors of cinnamon, vanilla, chocolate, bourbon, dark fruits, and the unique blend of tequila that makes this beer a little bit different from the traditional beer in this style.",4.47
Leche Borracho,"This will be a classic grain of salt-type review, as the bottle was clearly compromised in some way.",3.56
Leche Borracho,Great Peppers and spices coming through on this. Awesome cinnamon and chocolate notes as well. Bourbon and tequila mixed together and you can taste it and it tastes pretty amazing.,4.58
Leche Borracho,Mexican magic in a bottle big chocolate and spice with delicious sweetness from the Barrel to balance it all out. Just a delicious perfectly done barrel blend favorite spiced stout hands down no contest,4.98
Ghost In The Machine,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/23/2019. Pours opaquely hazy deep golden/orange/amber color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with amazing retention, that reduces to a large cap that lasts. Thick foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Amazing appearance. Aromas of big tangerine, orange juice, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, honeydew melon, gooseberry, citrus peel/zest, wood, onion, light peppercorn/pine, wheat, white bread dough, biscuit, light honey/toast, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/tropical/fairly earthy hops and bready malt notes; with big strength. Taste of huge tangerine, orange juice, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, honeydew melon, gooseberry, citrus peel/zest, wood, onion, light peppercorn/pine, wheat, white bread dough, biscuit, light honey/toast, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Very mild herbal, floral, woody, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tangerine, orange juice, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, honeydew melon, gooseberry, citrus peel/zest, wood, onion, light peppercorn/pine, wheat, white bread dough, biscuit, light honey/toast, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/fairly earthy hops and bready malt flavors; with a fantastic malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/bready, lightly sticky, and slightly resinous mouthfeel that is fantastic. Minimal warming alcohol after the finish for 8%. Overall this is an incredible NEDIPA. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/fairly earthy hops and bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV, with the mildly bitter/drying finish. Fantastic soft/silky feel for the ABV. Amazing Citra hop showcase. Extremely juicy, vibrant, and fairly dank/earthy hops; with a perfectly balanced wheat/oat/malt backbone. Light residual sweetness with lingering dryness. A highly enjoyable offering, and outstanding spot on style example. Loved the hop profile as expected.",4.28
Ghost In The Machine,"Very nice crisp hoppy IPA but a little disappointing considering the high ratings here. Bottled date 9/23/19 so I know it was fresh. Pours a yellowish hazy color with a thin cap of white head and some spotty lingering lacing. Aromas of grapefruit, pineapple and lemon with some malt, floral hops and vanilla. Taste follows the nose, balanced and tasty and just a little juicy. Smooth, mild, slightly sticky mouthfeel and good carbonation. Well-hidden higher ABV. Tasty, just didn't impress me a lot.",3.93
Ghost In The Machine,Pours out a beautiful hazy dark yellow. A finger of white head. Wow. It looks like pineapple juice. ,4.6
Ghost In The Machine,"Beautiful orange-juice orange body; head is thick, dense, and very creamy. Lightly sweet powdered sugar aroma; mild citrus element.

Heavy body; thick and velvety; very dry finish.",4.23
Ghost In The Machine,"I got a 4pck of this from Publics during a trip I took to Florence, AL. It poured a hazy orangish with white head that is not leaving much lace. The scent had nice citrus tones. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with tropical fruit peel presence. The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall its a solid beer.",4.16
Ghost In The Machine,One sip is all it takes to fall in love with this brew. I can smell the hops in my dreams. This is truly the future of mankind. Anybody who thinks otherwise can shotgun a double smoked IPA from Evermoore for all I care.,5

Ghost In The Machine,From tasting notes 06/25/19,3.81
Ghost In The Machine,"I bought four packs. I drank the first with friends, the ones who enjoyed IPAs really enjoyed it as well. When I initially drank it, the taste of the hops was a bit overwhelming. I've been having the last pack in my refrigerator since February to see how the taste would change. Still has a very overwhelming piney and citrus taste expected of such a beer, but the hops have actually toned down somewhat over time, and I feel the beer is better for it.",4.75
Ghost In The Machine,Serving: 12 oz bottle (“manifested of 06/11/19”) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass.,4.33
Ghost In The Machine,Simply amazing. By far my favorite beer I've ever had. This is the beer that started it all for me. Parish Brewing has solidified itself to me as a 100% trustworthy brewery with Ghost in the Machine being their best that I've tried.,4.84
Ghost In The Machine,What a great brew. ,4.72
Ghost In The Machine,"My rating averages the experience between fresh bottles and bottles that have aged a bit. There is a big difference between fresh bottles, and bottles that may have been stored appropriately (refrigerated) for six months. Fresh bottles are excellent, and would fall into my 4.5 range. Older bottles tend to throw a lot of sediment, and the flavor changes significantly for the worse. I'm drinking a bottle MANIFESTED ON 07/30/18, and I've got some major chunks at the bottom of my Nuit Belge Twenty Nineteen glass from New Orleans. I bought some more Ghost In The Machine in New Orleans that was MANIFESTED ON 02/26/19, and it is very good, just like my older batches were when they were (at most) four or five months old. I don't have enough experience to say when sedimentation begins, or when the flavor turns for the worse. But because this is a recurring theme, I'll caution you to drink when new and fresh nd enjoy. Later...not so much enjoyment is available.",4.13
Ghost In The Machine,"Poured into a tulip glass from bottle. Very fresh taste, citrus and hoppy. Aroma is outstanding. Pours a cloudy, straw color haze. Good head retention and silky mouthfeel. An outstanding double IPA",4.62
Ghost In The Machine,"Poured a bright and hazy peach color with almost no head. Just layers of bubbles at the surface. Aroma is incredible! It is heavy in the citrus with bitter rind but then the vanilla comes in unexpected. This beer is almost like vanilla ice cream with citrus peel. Tastes like a milkshake IPA. Lots of citrus, sweet and bitter and then comes the vanilla and lactose. Also notes of mango and other tropical fruits. Slight hop burn. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Almost thick and sticky. ",4.45
Ghost In The Machine,"This is the worst beer I have ever tasted. Period. I have a point here, which is if you are over 100 IBU, please put it on your bottle! I didn't ever need to try this, I just didn't have an internet connection when I bought it and no info on the bottle. Absolutely disgusting to me and I was already well aware that I do not like this much hops. All you had to do was print some info about the beer other than your ideal description which just says it's a ""double india pale ale"". Newsflash: there are double IPA's with lower than 50 IBU. Thanks a lot, I almost gagged the second I even got a whiff. Complete waste of money.",1
Ghost In The Machine,Found myself having a pint at the Bulldog in Baton Rouge back in August 2017. Brought a whole new level of craft beer into my life. I was able to get a growler fill after and since haven't had any but I am hooked and this is my GOAT! Wish I could get in PA....,5
Ghost In The Machine,"Pours a murky orange akin to a glass of orange juice. Head is a finger of rocky, white foam with fair retention. Aroma is orange, papaya, tangerine, lemon zest, melondew, and bready malts with a kiss of yeast. Flavor profile is tangerine, papaya, melon dew, lemon rind and zest, and mango. Big tropical fruits with zesty lemon. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a little silty, rindy, pillowy texture. Overall, zesty, sweet, and flavorful. ",4.45

Ghost In The Machine,Hop milk shake. Lots of citra so it has kind of a cat pee smell. I got use to it. I can only drink one at a sitting. Pretty good beer. Price is a bit high. 14.00 a 4 pack. Not worth it.,3.94
Ghost In The Machine,"Pours golden and hazy, citrusy aroma. It is much more citrus forward than I expected. I was imagining more tropical fruit, but there's a ton of citrus juice and rindy, minerally character. It is very good, but I can see why Nova Vert is more highly regarded.",4.24

Ghost In The Machine,Don't call people out for their reviews usually but in this instance I have to say Micky P missed the boat by a mile IMO. This is not my favorite style but this is my favorite NEIPA to date.,4.21
Ghost In The Machine,Nothing special in this NEIPA. If you have had most NEIPAs done in the south you will not be surprised this is just the same as all others. Taste was off on the pour I had. I have had this three times now and simply not impressed.,1.87

Clare's Thirsty Ale,"5/2/19 (Chicago): $12.47 12 oz. can prepaid purchase for January 2019 Haymarket brewery release, canned 12/28/18 and poured into snifter. Black pour, carbonation prevalent, tax head quickly dissipates living fine lacing. This release is 12% abv and labeled a barrel aged stout with raspberries. Raspberry aroma strong, nice balance with bourbon, overall sweet aroma. Taste mirrors aroma, raspberries are excellent, well blended taste with offsetting mellow but strong bourbon taste and roasted malt, tart cherry in the mix. Outstanding Stout! Slight fizzy carbonation, somewhat thin texture for a stout, nice and easy smooth drinking. Glad I poured this on a cold and rainy May Chicago evening.",4.59

Clare's Thirsty Ale,"I'm not generally one for fruited stouts - adjuncts in stouts should be restricted to vanilla, cinnamon, coffee, nuts, and whatever that isn't a fruit. But, Clare's Thirsty Ale was on the top 250 for years, so I had to try it.",4.56

Clare's Thirsty Ale,32oz growler poured into a snifter,4.34
Clare's Thirsty Ale,"been looking forward to trying this one for a long time and am stoked to have finally gotten the chance. this is a really neat and sort of unexpected beer, strange to name a strong barrel aged stout thirsty ale, like it implies easy drinking or high volume beer or something, but this is anything but, and it would take a special kind of thirst to want to drink a ton of this one. a rye whiskey barrel aged imperial stout with raspberries, and a wonderful one at that. i go back and forth on the fruited stouts, sometimes they get way too sweet and candy-like with the chocolate in the malt and the fruit sugars, but the raspberries are as tart as they are sweet in this, so while it has some residual sugar and raspberry jam qualities, its also really natural tasting, clean, and fairly acidic from their tartness. its amazing how forward the fruit is in such a dense strong dark beer. sure there is still plenty of dark malt in here, its intensely roasty with a coffee quality to it, and there is some barrel char and earthy wet wood as well, but the summery brightness of the berries lightens it all up and really defines this beer for me. rye is a smart choice for barrels too, its less sweet in this manifestation than bourbon would have been, and the dense slightly spicy rye character makes the grain base seem particularly interesting to me. light vanilla too, but it isnt desserty so much. dark cocoa, a little bitterness, and whiskey, along with old school raspberry jam in the finish, its just delicious and about as well done as something like this could be. this reminds me of an excellent raspberry stout i had from hardywood park a few years back but with the barrel, but other than that beer, quite original. worth the hype!",4.34
Clare's Thirsty Ale,Thanks Ryan for sharing a mini growler of this liquid. Poured into a tulip.,4.69
Clare's Thirsty Ale,"2014 vintage (Woodford Reserve barrels) - very nice incorporation of the base stout, raspberry and barrel notes. The raspberry adds a nice sweetness and jammy notes to a really well done BA stout.",4.37
Clare's Thirsty Ale,Always tough to balance fruits with barrel aged flavor but this one is harmonious. Huge fan of rye barrel flavors already so this templeton barrel is right up my alley though I am not a huge raspberry fan. However this works. Nose is literally a chocolate covered raspberries with subtle sweet rye barrel notes. Dessert beer start with a little booze barrel on the finish. Great beer.,4.73
Clare's Thirsty Ale,Black thick beer poured into a snifter. Minimal carbonation. Lots of chocolate raspberry on the nose. Bourbon followed by the sourness of the raspberry but wonderful balance. A little thin on the mouthfeel but minimally,4.71
Clare's Thirsty Ale,Glad I tracked down a growler of this!!! This turned out to be as good as everybody says! Hard to get! They need to bottle this beautiful Rick chocolate and raspberry BA stout!,5

Clare's Thirsty Ale,"Poured from a 32 oz growler into a snifter. Mild carbonation, dark brown with slight ruby edging. Big berry notes on the smell with mild barrel presence. Berry on the forefront of the taste, barrel is very mild. Smooth syrupy feel, alcohol is disguised well. Exceptional beer.",4.66
Clare's Thirsty Ale,This is like a sweeter version of Backyard Rye. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the night at a recent tasting. Certainly worth trying or seeking out if you are into fruited chocolate truffle flavors in your stouts.,4.58
Clare's Thirsty Ale,"Had a 10 oz pour straight from the tap yesterday. Looks like a standard BA stout with minimal head and pitch black. I can tell the base is a very solid BA stout, adjunct aside. This one isn't heavy on the barrel, and I don't love the idea of raspberry but it goes great this beer.",4.35
Clare's Thirsty Ale,"Haymarket is the type of place that I assume existed more commonly before the craft beer boom; a place that makes awesome beer, but somehow manages to stay under the radar (possibly due to how close it is to Au Cheval and every other trendy restaurant in the area).",4.58
Clare's Thirsty Ale,"Huge raspberry, fresh dark chocolate, cocoa, light roast, sweet, some bourbon",4.34
Clare's Thirsty Ale,Phenomenal brew right here. Was lucky to get a howler of this divine beer. The fruit plays so well with everything. They need to bottle this beer someday please!!!,4.96
Clare's Thirsty Ale,Huge raspberry nose jumping out of the glass. Tastes like chocolate dipped raspberry. There are vanilla and oak notes as well as some balance from the bourbon. The raspberry really shines here.,4.95
Clare's Thirsty Ale,"Finally got to tick this brew, during Haymarket's 5th Anniversary Party (I flew out to Chicago, from Delaware), just for the chance to try this legend. And it did not disappoint! Rich, lush, velvety, full-bodied chocolate raspberry stout, with excellent depth, body, and mouthfeel. And I got to meet Clare & Pete as well. Fabulous experience.

Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,"If this was one 330mL bottle, maybe I could tolerate it more. As is, the sourness affects the teeth and gives acid reflux to regret. Too much. ",3.28
Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,"Poured a copper-tinted reddish body with fizzy carbonation but no head or lace. The aroma is sour/tart and chock full of cranberries and cherries along with some razzies and oak. Excellent balance between tart cherries, sour/sharp cranberries, some raspberry sweetness and an oaky smoothness with no booze and a filling body.",4.18
Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,"What an amazing color!!..a semi-cloudy light strawberry color with a quickly disappating light pink head. Aroma is full, so full. of strawberries, light cranberries and sweet cherries. Taste has just a light touch of sourness from the cherries and a great balance of sweetness in the form of cherries and raspberries. Yeast and Belgian feel is so light and makes this beer so so drinkable at 7%abv. The tartness lays on the tip of the tongue and does not overpower the goodness of the main ingredients. Finish is incredibly refreshing and has a great feel of fresh beries throughout.This one is a winner !",4.2
Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,Bottle 3 of 4. Finally getting down to reviewing this legendary brew. Cork and cage 750 ml bottle and cost was a mere $8.70 CDN. Probably should've picked up another half dozen of these. A fine way to conclude Canada Day! Served cold into a chalice.,4.67

Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,"This is it - the ultimate sour beer I've ever tasted. So dangerously drinkable - the sourness and the fruitiness is in perfect balance and harmony.

Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,"Is Rodenbach the world's best brewery, Belgian style at least? This is simply sensational. I drank this out of my handy Garre glass from a 750 ml bottle I kept outside in the low 50's. The beautiful red color bubbles to a quickly vanishing light fizz emitting an earthy, fruity aroma my 4yr old child described as ""rotten fruit candy"". The taste is fresh fruit (but kinda Faygo Rockin' Rye!) followed by oakiness and that delicious Flanders red base. An Earthy tart dry finish. This is showing off just how sophisticated ""beer"" can be. Sublime, complex, wow.",5

Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,"#1,000 for reals this time. I’ve been squirrelling so much anticipation, ewe wouldn’t even believe, but bear with me - this is a massive milestone, let me crow about it [animal puns: success!]. 7 years ago I posted my first review on beeradvocate.com, and in that time I’ve had many many great beers, and in the last few years less and less crap beers. TBH I realised life is short there are too many beers out there for one man to drink (and review) so I’ve been sticking with the “good stuff”. Rodenbach Caractère Rouge: good stuff I’ve heard, plus I already love Rodenbach Grand Cru, seems like a no brainer. No, it isn’t my usual “what’s the BIGGEST (ABV) beer I can get my hands on”, but let’s give something different a go (yo!).",4.45

Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Super excited to try a BA version of one of my favorite beers, let alone a maple barrel version! Smell takes on more of the flavors from the original: cocoa, cinnamon, vanilla, hot peppers, cake breadiness, black strap molasses, slight dark fruit and smoke, plus then the bourbon and wood from the barrel, maple is there but faint. Not as pure smelling as original, but heavier. Taste is incredible, so much complexity, take all of those aromas from the smell, add smoky maple, caramel, and rich malt work. Finish has good kick from peppers, plus counters the sweetness and robust barrel well. Feel has the spice, has deep richness, has robust barrel elements, sweet adjuncts, and some graininess too, just so much goodness. An amazing beer, apparently I rated the orignal higher, but honestly for me they are equals, just depends on your mood",4.68

Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Dark cola with a mocha head that quickly recedes to an ever-present ring with no lacing. Thick heavy alcohol legs coat the glass when titled. Aroma is bourbon, maple syrup, and chocolate. Taste is sugar, big time chocolate, cinnamon, bourbon, and habanero in that order. It is very complex, and the flavors compliment each other instead of conflicting with each other. There is a long lingering peppery burn which makes this beer standout to me in comparison to Hunahpu’s and Abraxas. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth and coating. Overall this is an absolute treat. I love the base beer, but the Maple Bourbon barrel treatment makes an amazing beer world-class.",5
Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"I found this variation to obviously be of the same commendable quality as ""plain"" BAMC, but a bit sweeter with a touch more raisin. I didn't really get the smoky, caramelized maple flavor I was hoping for, but hey, can't complain about getting another version of barrel aged Mexican Cake. It still has that distinct spicy heat with a slick, thin body that finishes semi-dry.",4.13

A little too sweet and even though it's much spicier, it doesn't elevate it.",4

Emerald Grouper,"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 9/24/2019. Pours fairly hazy deep golden amber/light orange color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a large cap that lasts. Thick foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big red grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, lime, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, honeydew melon, guava, blueberry, gooseberry, citrus peel/rind, wood, mint, peppercorn, pine, honey, cracker, toasted biscuit, light caramel/nuttiness, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness.

Taste of huge red grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, lime, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, honeydew melon, guava, blueberry, gooseberry, citrus peel/rind, wood, mint, peppercorn, pine, honey, cracker, toasted biscuit, light caramel/nuttiness, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish.

Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops, honey, and bready malt flavors; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance, and no lingering hop astringency after the finish. Fairly crisp finishing. Moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium-plus carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and sticky/resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Mild increasing warmth of 9.5% After the finish. Overall this is a fantastic DIPA. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops, honey, and bready malt flavors; dangerously smooth and easy to drink for the big ABV, with the moderately bitter/resinous/drying finish; not overly aggressive. Amazing Simcoe, Citra, Galaxy and Mosaic profile. Extremely vibrant, juicy, dank, and earthy hops; with a nice sized honey and bready malt backbone. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp resin dryness. A highly enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example. Loved the hop profile as expected.",4.23

It feels more like it's own beer than an Abraxas variant, as most of the cinnamon and pepper is subdued by the coffee. Not a bad thing, just different than what I expected.",4.53
Coffee Abraxas,Very thankful for a good friend that went to the Abraxas release this year and then shared each of the variants at bottle shares. I love the regular Abraxas. But the coffee variant adds an awesome layer to an already great beer.,4.6
Coffee Abraxas,"Pours black and after a very moderate intensity pour, nets near zero head. What head is there comes via a ring of khaki foam that lingers a long while. Aroma is huge, hitting all the notes of the base beer - cinnamon, cardamon, nutmeg, chilies and other spices. Dark chocolate and cocoa powder add a little dry sweetness. Medium-bodied, dark coffee is interwoven throughout the structure of the nose, never taking the limelight, instead subtly reminding the palate it's there. Roasty, toasty malts add firm and dark support, but are an afterthought to the additive flavors. Flavor profile is deep notes of mingling cardamon, nutmeg, ancho (mild) chilies and cinnamon with medium-bodied, dark coffee, and roasty malts up front. Medium-bodied coffee hits center stage for a brief glimpse between spices and malts, and then returns to lingering and observing from aside the curtain. While spices eagerly welcome each sip like a used car salesman do for a visitor to the lot, they quickly fade to show the frame work of this beer - roasty, toasty, nutty malts - in other words, robust and dark. Between the dynamics of spices, coffee, and malts, there are flashes of chocolate, cocoa powder, and molasses. Very dynamic despite a slightly heavy hand on the spices. Perhaps more so than any other beer I've had, serving temperature is critical here. Too cold and the spices come off heavy, but as the beer warms a touch, the spices meld into the dark malt backdrop, forming a sublime experience. As this beer nears the 50F mark, it develops a sublime balance. Mouth feel is medium-thick, with a smooth, creamy texture that develops a fairly still texture when served directly out of the fridge. As the beer warms, it develops a more grainy, velvety texture, enhancing the experience. Overall, the headline here is ""ABRAXAS"", with the subtitle being ""enters a non-mutually exclusive relationship with coffee"". Coffee is present, particularly as the beer warms, but never steps into the limelight for more than a brief second or two. Due to the namesake of this beer ""Coffee Abraxas"", this is a slight disappointment, although it is still a dynamic, complex stout worthy of cozying up to on the coldest of nights.",4.34
Coffee Abraxas,"I am normally not a big fan of cinnamon in my stouts but the coffee really hides it in this. Balancing it out very well, I actually like this more than OG Abraxas.",5
Coffee Abraxas,"Got this in a trade awhile back and left it in the fridge for about 6 months before tasting with family and friends recently. I honestly think this helped preserve the coffee flavor, which was still strong and very well-balanced. I've never had BAA or regular Abraxas, but I will say that this was the first beer we drank on Dark Lord Day 18, and it was definitely the best beer we drank all day.",4.99
Coffee Abraxas,I'm sorry but regular abraxis is better. I was disappointed this varaints didn't have a stronger coffee flavor. I had it from the tap at the brewery pub.,3.99
Coffee Abraxas,"Black with a large mocha foam that dies to a creamy thin blanket, then nothing, leaving brown legs that stain the glass with a swirl.",4.07
Coffee Abraxas,"The beer pours a Pitch Black with a large frothy brown head. It has medium carbonation. The beer smells of cinnamon sticks, coffee roast, baker’s chocolate, hot pepper, cayenne, and nutmeg. It tastes of cinnamon sticks, roasted coffee beans, cayenne, nutmeg, with mild chille heat. The mouthfeel is medium and creamy. Overall, a very good stout from Perrnnial. Just wish there was more spicy, hunapu is my favorite in this style of stout.",4.47
Coffee Abraxas,"Looks like a black hole..smell is cinnamon, coffee and chili peppers..my throat tingles a bit from the chilli pepper..taste is cinnamon up front mixed nicely with the chili pepperz and coffee is bringing up the rear..very nicely done.. sweet and thick with very little carbonation..this turns the regular abraxas up a hefty notch, and is quite delicious..one of the best coffee stouts ive had and one of the best stouts period..fantastic!!",4.61
Coffee Abraxas,"RBSG 17 grand tasting. Oily black pour, thin ring of beige head, curtains of lacing. Aroma has coffee (as expected) up front, lot sof coffee cake flavors behind. Taste has the roast malts, coffee, cinnamon and chocolate, raisins. A big breakfast sweet roll. Nice",4
Coffee Abraxas,Poured from a 22oz bomber into a Perennial stemmed wine glass. Thanks Ray for sharing this one. ,4.74
Coffee Abraxas,"2017 bottle poured into a tulip. Poured deep black with a mocha head. Smells of cinnamon, spice and subtle coffee. I could smell this beer forever. Taste was amazing...rich cinnamon and spice all balanced out by the coffee. Really enjoyable. Feel was slick, mouth coating and spot on for the style. Overall, this beer is outstanding in the spiced stout category. Not sure I’ve had one (non BA) that I enjoyed as much as this.",4.81
Coffee Abraxas,"It poured out as a rich deep black color with a mocha colored head on top. The smell of the beer is good but the coffee is a bit masked by the cinnamon. The taste of the beer has a good balance of flavors. The coffee is still a little hidden but creeeps through in the finish. The feel of the beer is very nice, smooth and rich. Overall it’s a very good brew. A real treat to try!",4.26
Coffee Abraxas,2017 bottling.,4.26
Coffee Abraxas,"Abraxas is my favorite Stout, and the Coffee varient does not disappoint. Tastes of Cinnamon, Chocolate, and Coffee. If you like Coffee stouts this is sure to impress.",4.94
Coffee Abraxas,Mouth feel was ok. Straight cinnamon on the nose. Not much coffee on the taste. Nice thick and dark. This was a 2015 so it definitely has dropped off.,4.26
Coffee Abraxas,Pours jet black thick like used motor oil mocha colored head,4.84
Coffee Abraxas,"Served in an 8 oz glass, None of the legendary Abraxas flavor for me in this 2016 vintage. Prob should have drank it sooner. Taste like burnt coffee w a weak sugary flavor.",4.03
Coffee Abraxas,750ml bottle poured into a snifter,4.35
Coffee Abraxas,"This beer is just perfect. The spices merge perfectly with the Sump coffee and form a brew that is smooth, flavorful, and absolutely delicious. I could drink this on a cool morning and be perfectly happy",4.71
Coffee Abraxas,"2016 vintage, poured from the bottle into a taster. Typical Abraxas flavor with a bit of coffee - not considerably better than regular Abraxas, but the coffee works well and does not overpower the traditional Abraxas flavor profile.",4.5
Coffee Abraxas,"I didn't get a ton of coffee in this, just a hint. Is that the idea with this? Seems perhaps that way with the other reviews but folks also rave about big coffee notes and flavors. Either way, was still Abraxas and my scoring would've been higher had it lived up to actually being ""Coffee"" Abraxas. Simply because the coffee was so minimal.",4.56
Coffee Abraxas,"Odd to say, but I though it was better than regular Abraxas, and regular Abraxas might be the best regular stout I have ever had. Perfect balance of coffee and spice, soft but full mouthfeel, taste to kill for.",5
Coffee Abraxas,Wow! How can you improve on a great beer?? You add coffee!! Perfect addition to the already great abraxas flavors. The coffee adds a great creamy roasty addition! Perfect!,5
Fyodor,"Rich, dense, smooth and delicious. Tons of cocoa, caramel, vanilla, coffee with subtle waves of anise, bourbon and black currants. Very complex and tasty. I will definitely get this one again if I come across it.",4.46
Fyodor,"Pours black with a finger of thin, large khaki bubbles. Aroma is toffee, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, and roasty and toasty malts. Bourbon adds a kiss of heat to the back, which is soothed out by oak. Flavor profile is really well developed, hitting notes of roasty, toasty and caramely malts with sugary notes of caramel, toffee, molasses and brown sugar. Bourbon is present, but not out of place, adding a subtle twinge of heat that works to establish a better balance. Oak and char add a little smooth bitterness at the finish. Mouth feel is still with very little nuance to the texture. It has a full and thick consistency. Overall, stout is solid with subtle and well maintained levels of flavor, heat and bourbon. ",4.31
Fyodor,Poured from a 2017 bottle into a snifter. Carbonation is moderate. I was hoping this would be a bit thicker. Nice barrel presence in both aroma and flavor.,4.33
Fyodor,"L - Deep, opaque black with a dark tan head that dissipates quickly and leaves behind minimal lacing. ",4.51
Fyodor,"L: Dark Black except where light fringes the glass for a chocolate brown, a third finger dark mocha head with little retention or lacing.",3.6
Fyodor,"Appearance is very dark brown with a loosely formed tan head. Head has moderate retention, but minimal lacing. Aroma is dark roasted malt, raisins, and a hint of anise. Taste adds molasses, coffee, and vanilla to the mix. It’s still quite hot, but should mellow with age. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous.",4.55
Fyodor,Pitch black to dark brown with a slight hint of Ruby when held to the light. Topped with a half finger of rusty dark brown beige head. ,4.19

Fyodor,"Pours black with an everlasting ring of tan head that leaves sparse dots of lacing. Smells of bourbon, oak, coffee and char. Tastes of bourbon, cold brew coffee, oak, dark chocolate, cocoa, dark roasted malts char, vanilla, caramel and a hint of tobacco. Full bodied, light carbonation, creamy and chewy mouth feel and a dry finish.",4.36

Fyodor,"Drinking this tonight at a share with my husband and his two friends. I told them that they had to get this for me a while back and they finally came through, bout time!",5
Fyodor,"Drinking tonight at a share with a few buddies and we have been trying to get this for a long time. Boy oh boy was it worth the wait. Chocolate, coffee, caramel. Great!",5
Fyodor,"Have a small stash, so time to christen one. Poured cellar temp hard to a tulip glass. Color is deep mahogany. Head is three fingers, tan plumper they leaves some scant lacing. Nose is predominantly vanilla with a little char on the backend. First sips are char, vanilla, roasty, malty goodness. Very full,smooth mouthfeel. If you had it, you get the base RIS all day, but the bourbon and barrel give you a nice bite, without being overbearing. Mellow, creaminess reminds me of a Prairie Artisan Paradise, where the coconut levels it out. No alcohol bite, but it hits you after a little time. Get it! Just letting out doofus dog on the deck and this is a great beer for a brisk winter night.",4.57
Fyodor,"Welcome to my Happy New Russian Stone Beer Sunday (Week 729)! I have all three (3) of Stone's 2018 Small Batch Series in readiness. This week, I have been reading ""The Greatest Russian Stories of Crime and Suspense"" as edited by Otto Penzler & yesterday, during my neighborhood church's Attic Treasures monthly rummage sale, I scored two (2) souvenir glasses from St. Petersburg. Additionally, St. Amandus had his birthday on Saturday so it seems as though the Beer Gods want today to happen. Don't like my idea? As they say in Moscow, ""Toughski shitski, comrade!"" ",4.66
Fyodor,"Black-bodied beer under a finger of tan foam... Similar to Mikhail, but without that coffee infusion... Aromas and flavors of charred wood, roasted black malts, and cold espresso coffee; not too sweet - the bittersweet chocolate leans more toward the bitter side, with a drying finish... Medium-bodied and smooth - a very nice stout...",4.5
Fyodor,A-Pours a jet black color with a slight head and lacing,4.5
Fyodor,"The beer pours a delicious looking and creamy brown head that dissipates at a moderate pace. The beer itself has a nice dark chocolate black color with a thick looking yet smooth texture to it. The smell is delicious. It has a good bourbon and vanilla notes upfront and are the stronger smells while the dark chocolate is slightly overwhelmed but still manages to appear in the finish. The taste is surprisingly very different from the smell. The bourbon notes and vanilla come out more in the finish while a bitter dark chocolate and coffee notes along with a decent wood note are upfront. The feel is really good with a heavy body but very silky and bubbly carbonation feel to it. Overall, this is a fantastic beer worth getting a hold of if you can.",4.5
Fyodor,"Bottle dated October 2018 into pint glass. Pours a very dark brown with a thin tan head. Initial impression is milk chocolate, coffee, booze, maybe a hint of dark fruits. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth. Carbonation is light. Finish is smooth and chocolatey, fading to a noticeable coffee/expresso bite in the back of the throat. Definitely a sipper, but oh my it is good! First Stone offering I've had in a long time, but it was worth the wait.",4.06
Fyodor,"Dark brown / black pour with thin creme colored lacing. Oak and bourbon aroma with some booziness. Taste is predominantly oak and bourbon with some chocolate and light char. Full bodied, thick, ",4.25
Kiwi Herman,"I sat on this bottle for a bit - I was afraid that the fruit had fallen off and it would just be a funky sour. Thankfully, age has done this zero harm... the beer is quite fragrant, instantly - tons of strawberry to the nose with some sour notes as well. I didn't catch the kiwi, but I don't know kiwi all that well, honestly.",4.46

Kiwi Herman,Thanks Ryan for Sharing. 16 oz bottle into a tulip. ,4.4
Kiwi Herman,"Most recent batch poured into a stemmed tulip. Golden amber in color. Very minimal head that dissipates quick. Aroma of lactic acid in subtle fruit. Taste is strawberry, kiwi and some biscuit. Tastes like a sour strawberry shortcake. Feel is light bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this is a well done fruited sour. My only gripe would be that I think it’s just a touch too sour for me.",4.35
Kiwi Herman,L: Slightly hazy golden and dark peach hues with a frothy white head and minimal lacing/retention,4.67
Kiwi Herman,I've had this a bunch all batch 1. It's like sour snapple kiwi strawberry,5

Kiwi Herman,500ml bottle. Served in a stemmed glass.,4.23
Kiwi Herman,"This is one of the rare beers that I will say is worth the hype. This is in my top 5 sour beers. The nose start with a 50/50 blend of sweet and sour. The sour is acidic, citrus, and farmhouse. The sweet is strawberry, caramel, and tropical fruit. The flavor matches but brings the beer to the next level. The balance and flavor is nearly unparalleled. There is the sour and tart from the microflora that is the best of any sour out there. The sweetness from the fruits is there. The strawberry is more dominate then the kiwi but both are present. Well done Alpine, I hope they bring this beer back.",4.88
Kiwi Herman,"split this bottle with my buddy paul. really nice and delicate sour with nice kiwi notes. the thing that makes it dance in your mouth is the strawberry. I find that strawberry is a hard flavor to convey well in a beer and this one kills it. very good, but not sure it was worth the price of admission.",4.5
Kiwi Herman,"Poured light golden. Nose mostly of strawberry. I think the Kiwi was thrown in just for the name. Taste follows nose, medium tartness, uneventful. Thin body. Not much going on in this beer, very forgettable other than the fact that it rode the Chez train giving the ultimate testament to name hype.",4.03
Kiwi Herman,"Aroma is distinctly kiwi and strawberry but has a hint of artificiality to it that bothers me; a kind of candied, crystal light fruit tone ... bag of Haribo gummy candies. Flavor is light and clean, spritzy and refreshing, light balanced acidity. Drinks more like an artisinal Bartles & James / wine cooler than a beer. The base is transparent to the point of being virtually non-existent. Tasty but something of a novelty, lacking in real complexity.",4.24
Kiwi Herman,"Pour is a nice light golden amber with a medium white head that lasts a couple minutes. Aroma is a slight kiwi presence with a good amount of oak and white grapes. The strawberry kiwi combo comes through in the flavor and balances the oak and acetic acid nicely with a good middle of the road sourness. Mouthfeel is very effervescent, great overall.",4.69
Kiwi Herman,This one has been very elusive for me and I was excited to try it. (And with great thanks to the person who opened it at our tasting 8/22/15; very generous of you).,3.59
Kiwi Herman,"Great nose of strawberry and can even get the kiwi if I look for it along with some woody wine barrel notes. Taste is very similar. Tart fresh strawberry, some sour kiwi. wine barrel and very light funk. Thanks so much cocoapuph!!",4.4
Kiwi Herman,"Pour is golden amber with a fizzy white head. Nose has a moderate oak presence, fleshy kiwi fruit, white grape, hint acetic. Flavor follows suit, nothing excessively bright but nothing glaringly wrong. Light plastic phenol is blended with oak and white grapes, slightly vinous, kiwi is fleshy and ripe, lightly acetic through the finish. Soft body, moderate carb, a touch syrupy and heavy.",3.42
Kiwi Herman,Definitely get the strawberry--get the sour of the kiwi but not so much the sweetness. Had it fresh and then again about 3 months old. Definitely better fresh.,4.25
Kiwi Herman,Bottle shared by ygtsbm94. Thanks Brad!,4.45
Kiwi Herman,"Was not as impressed by this as I had hoped. This is a good beer, but the flavors were a bit muted. The hype around this far exceeded its taste. Very good beer, but there are many others of similar quality. The best part was the funk at the bottom, which is where the flavors really came through.",4.24

Casey / Side Project - Leaner,"killer beer, amazing to have in such close proximity with the westly, which although was apricot and not peaches, makes a great side by side. the beers are similar in some ways, but this was much more interesting on the yeast front, much less sour, equally fruity. peaches rule this one, drippy and ripe just like the namesake, aroma and flavor are the peak of ripeness, hardly sweet at all, just juicy and true, fuzzy and woody and awesome. soft yellowish orange beer, hazy and heady, well carbonated, dry, and who knew it was so strong on the booze? you dont taste it in the least nor feel it at all. brett out in front of souring cultures in this one for me, funky and layered and real mature. this must have spent quite a bit of time ageing, fermenting all this fruit out. the peaches are insane, yellow and bursting out of this. in some ways, the sourness takes over the apricot in westly a bit, here, the fruit leads the way and is merely accentuated by the yeasts. still plenty of acid, but a lot of nuance to it, maybe less wood, but more interesting i think. i like this as much as i liked either westly or fuzzy from side project in isolation, and think if they made more of it, it would have to be one of the most hyped beers ever. its immediately in that range with stuff like fou foune, cascade, allagash, and the other greatest peach or apricot lambics out there. lots of wheaty body, even oaty, fluffy and expansive, inviting, micro bubbles are very active in it too. i couldnt imagine this improving in any way, its a truly beautiful beer. thanks to claystation for sharing it with us, a real treat, and a new high water mark for casey, and thats really saying something if you have been keeping up with their releases lately...",4.64

Casey / Side Project - Leaner,"Lucky enough to try on tap at Falling Rocks in Denver. If you've heard the hype, believe it. It's what I imagine fermented peaches would taste like.

Very bright fruit, little to no peach or stone-fruit skin (ala AdF) juicy as hell as the name would suggest. A real joy to drink. My favorite from Troy yet.

Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,"Pours an opaque pale orange that looks like a matte shade of wheat. Head is a finget of white foam, but disappates quickly. Aroma is big and bold tropical fruit that remain unchallenged or phased. Nectarine, tangerine, mango, orange and lemon all hit the nose in a barrage of citrus. Flavor profile is more citrus, but a little more refined and smooth here. Notes come via tangerine, orange, mandarin orange and nectarine. There is a little yeasty prominence at the finish, along with a bit of hop bite. The bite is staccato and short. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a pillowy texture.

Birth Of Tragedy,"Kochere variant (apple brandy) - drank 7/13/2019. Bottle opened at Hill Farmstead - incredible surprise. Best beer of the weekend. Layered, rich, amazing apple brandy. So incredible.",5
Birth Of Tragedy,"Black color with creamy brownish head. Aroma is spicy with some liquorice and aromatic herbs. Also dark fruits and whiskey. Taste is bittersweet, roasty, chocolate forward with well integrated bourbon. Medium to full bodied with soft mouthfeel. Overall it's a really well balanced and tasty beer.",4.6
Birth Of Tragedy,"Slick oily black with a seemingly headless, smooth silky surface that slowly develops a thin mocha film and a bubbly collar.",4.31
Birth Of Tragedy,"Hill Farmstead is plain and simply the best brewery I have ever been to. I would say that it is the best of all time but who really knows? Everything I have had from there, I'm not sure if you could find anything wrong with it.",5
Birth Of Tragedy,"2016 batch, hard to tell what month due to a smudge on the date stamp. The honey is still a standout, lending a natural sweetness and floral aroma as a counterpoint to the base porter's roasted bitterness, and drying out the finish. The earthy, nutty coffee is less obvious on the nose but still shows up on the palate, alongside an obvious, but not dominating, bourbon and oak character from the barrel. Moderately full body with an exceptionally smooth mouthfeel.",4.34
Birth Of Tragedy,"Bottled 9.21.16, almost a year old. Poured from a 500mL bottle into a hill farmstead tulip. Purchased at the brewery. ",4.44

Birth Of Tragedy,2011 version. Had a 4 oz pour at the brewery.,4.65
Birth Of Tragedy,Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color porter with a deep brown color head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of coffee with some bourbon notes and nice vanilla notes. Taste is a complex and rich mix of nice vanilla notes with bourbon and rich black chocolate notes and a sweet honey-laced finish. Body is full with deep oily texture and good carbonation with hints of warming alcohol notes. Very rich porter but a bit too much honey for my taste.,4.21

Birth Of Tragedy,"From bottle. Near black. Dark head dissipated to slicks. Smell is elegant. Good, clean malts. Surprised this isn't BA. Has a rich caramel and vanilla element. Sweet and smooth. HF feel never disappoints. Great beer.",4.48
Birth Of Tragedy,"Dark pour with a tan head that leaves a ring around the glass as you drink it. Roasted malts and coffee on the nose with some bourbon barrel. Honey sweetness blends nicely with coffee, oak, dark fruits, dark chocolate, and bourbon. My lips were sticky after the first sip. A nice, thick body on this beer. Overall, a very tasty beer.",4.53
Birth Of Tragedy,Beautiful pitch black pour with a moderate khaki head,4.72
Birth Of Tragedy,"Drinks like a stout. Dark roast flavors, and a really nice vanilla and bourbon added from the barrel. Complex as a porter can be. Don't expect a huge BA stout, it is a porter after all, but if you want a well made example of an imperial with stout like characteristics, this is the one.",4.49
Birth Of Tragedy,"This thing is way under the radar. Black pour, thick dense head, and lots of bourbon and vanilla to enjoy on the nose and palate. Smooooothness and Drinkability is the story on this one!",4.6
Birth Of Tragedy,"Pours black with tan head. There's some barrel aroma, vanilla and booze. It really is super balanced, delicate, and well finessed. The honey seems to subdue the barrel character or at least keep it from being as heavy handed as some other BBA stouts. There's some chocolate in there too. It's super smooth to the point where the bourbon punch is a pinch. BoT is just a phenomenal porter.",4.54
Birth Of Tragedy,"This shit is the truth! Poured into a stemmed Hill Farmstead balloon glass. Pitch black small amount of khaki head. Nice coffee, bourbon, oak, vanilla, chocolate nose. It's best attribute is taste, everything comes together, such balance... a real masterpiece! Mouthfeel is excellent medium/full - full, low carb. Overall one of HF's best offerings!",4.89
Birth Of Tragedy,Nice complex taste with this beer. Really well done and I think underrated. Not too sweet at all and the coffee notes are perfect. Great smell and the body is amazing.,4.34
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"
Tastes very booze forward, with an uncompromising interplay between chilies and bourbon. By developing such a hot bite, the beer misses out on its smoothness, which the regular version is able to provide.",3.45
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Pours a pitch black coloration with a medium, creamy, dark brown head. Smells of rich, dark chocolate, cinnamon and chili peppers, with a hint of vanilla, oak and quite a hot bourbon note. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by rich, bitter chocolate, roasted malts and spicy chili peppers, with a good amount of vanilla and lighter notes of cinnamon, dark fruits: fig, raisins, some oak and a light earthiness. There's also quite a hot, boozy bourbon note to this. It starts out a little sweet, with the chocolate and vanilla standing out the most, but turns more a lot more bitter and warming in the aftertaste. Finishes with a medium bitterness, vanilla notes, and some heat, both from the chili and booze, lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a rich body and low carbonation. This thankfully doesn't have that odd, floral chili note that normal Huna has, the chilies feeling a lot more sharp and spicy. A little less earthy and bitter as well, with more vanilla sweetness and a lot more booziness. slightly richer dark fruit notes as well. Mouthfeel is actually quite a bit worse though, not having quite that thick, almost viscous quality to it that normal Huna has. Still quite smooth though. I actually think that the heat from the chilies and the booze work together quite well to create quite an aggressive character works well with the bitterness and is balanced out nicely by a certain sweetness from the vanilla.",4.39

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"The beer pours a Pitch Black with a thin film of khaki head that immediately recedes. The carbonation is low. It smells of chocolate, mocha, chilli peppers, cinnamon, hint of vanilla, and bourbon. The beer tastes of chocolate, chilli peppers, mocha, cinnamon, bark, with a bourbon kick. The mouthfeel is light and creamy, lots of complexity and so smooth. This is a special beer, there aren’t many big stouts that I could drink all day and this is one of them.",4.55
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"750ml bottle, 2017 release. Bottling date of 08/16/18 etched on the neck of the bottle. Bourbon and oak dominate the nose with more moderate notes of cinnamon and peppers. The smell definitely gets better as it warms with the bourbon barrel notes dominating and also the cinnamon, chile peppers, and cacao nibs that make the regular Hunahpu’s so amazing are hiding behind the barrel notes. The taste is all the great flavors of Hunahpu’s with a slightly spicy and warming finish.",4.6

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"2017 vintage. Tremendous taste and nose. Light coconut, spice, plenty of cinnamon. Not a very pronounced barrel presence, but it's there. It's surprising how excellent this is, but being a fan of the base beer, it should probably be expected.",4.71
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"750ml bottle, of the 2017 release (blue El Catador label). Served in a Cigar City snifter glass. Pours a dark motor oil black body, half finger mocha head, short retention, not much in way of lacing. Big legs on this bad boy. Smell is rich bourbon and chocolate fudge; the bourbon is a smooth and slightly warming presence, oak and charred caramel. Milk chocolate, touch of cinnamon, and touch of cocoa rounds it out. It's a very smooth, well-integrated bourbon barrel on the aroma working with the base beer. Flavour is a bit muddled, however. I get a bit of milk chocolate and a touch of cinnamon up front, with a more astringent and bitter cocoa. Hunahpu's has never been a super cinnamon forward beer, and it shows here. There is mostly milk chocolate, cocoa, and a fair bit of whiskey flavour and heat. A bit of vanillin perhaps thickens up the mouthfeel on the backend some. I do notice a fair bit of extra heat on the backend, that lingers for a little bit after you've finished your sip, a bit of a sting to it. Pretty solid, and the balance is what I remember the base beer to have, except the bourbon adds on an additional dimension. The mouthfeel is heavy and thick-bodied, lower in carbonation but adequate, oily with a bit of whiskey and pepper heat on the finish. A fun beer to finally tick, even if it took until the 2017 release to do so.",4.4
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Bourbon is soft, well balanced and tones down the cinnamon, chocolate and other notes. Silky smooth mouth feel; easy on the palate. Worth the bottle...Prost!!",5
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Shared with friends at CBC Como on 1-27-18. 2017 version(blue label). Pours about as black as it gets with no real head to speak of. Great nose, with hints of cinnamon and spice predominant, and a hint of barrel. From there, I guess I was a bit let down. Having the regular version on a few occasions, I was expecting the barrel treatment to give this beer a boost. Instead, the flavors come off a little muddled. Yes, I got some cinnamon, cocoa, and chilies(most unaffected), but they were struggling to the forefront with the presence of the barrel itself.",4.33
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Pours opaque black with no head, just a tight band around the edges. Nose reveals rich chocolate and ethanol. Taste expresses cocoa, cinnamon, honey and a kiss of heat. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild, even carbonation. Overall, a solid offering. I'm not a huge fan of chili stouts; however, this was pleasant and unassuming.",4.15

Finish is smooth and sweet.",4.54

Tweak,"This monster of a beer is one I have wanted to try. Some of the first beers I drank was from Avery. Elle's Brown Ale was one of those fond beer memories back in the day. I served the beer in a tulip glass at 50 degrees. It would be a miracle if any head formed considered the high alcohol content. A vigorous pour produced a one finger medium tan head with fair retention. The beer's head took a couple minutes to dissipate and leaving no lacing on the glass. The head is creamy and foamy, settling to a thin ring around the glass. The color the beer is SRM 36 a dark brown to inky black. The beer is opaque. ",4.6
Tweak,"Tweak is a great tasting Imperial Stout, coffee, bourbon, and it's strong, a bit on the sweet side. It is strong so watch out. Summary:",4.49
Tweak,Absolutely fabulous. This beer is a real treat. Very sweet and multi flavored. I get some aged raisin but there are so many things happening it's hard to describe e. High alcohol and you can taste it. Only plan to drink one (it's all you can afford anyway). Buy it!,4.92

Tweak,Very bright coffee and nuanced esters for such a big boozy beer. Bourbon barrel influence creates an almost apple pie note when combined with the coffee. Not all bitter or black malt here. More of an imperial porter with amazing wood - residual heat keeps it evolving as the beer warms up on the glass,4.35

Tweak,12oz bottle.,4.53
Tweak,"Pours a pitch black coloration with a tiny, fizzy head. Smells of dark and lighter red fruit, dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla, molasses, toffee and brown sugar. Taste is similarily complex, but a little too sweet and boozy, dominated by the sweeter and barrel-heavy notes of vanilla, bourbon, toffee, molasses and brown sugar, with lighter notes of dark and red fruits: date, raisin, cherry, dark chocolate, coffee and oak. Finishes quite sweet, with a very light bitterness and quite a boozy bourbon aftertaste. Thick, oily mouthfeel with quite a rich body and low carbonation. I would actually prefer Mephistopheles over this, which has a lot more interesting flavour profile that just gets muddled up by the strong, boozy bourbon notes of this. I will also say that, given the HUGE 17.8% ABV of the 2014 batch, this is *relatively* impressively mellow, but still slighty over the top for my personal taste. At the ned of the day, this just proves to me that BBA and added addjunks don't necessarily make things better. To me the subtle nuances of Mephistopheles get drowned out in slightly to sweet and boozy brew here.",4.11

Tweak,"Almost black with a a modest dark tan head that soon subsided to a ring around the edge. Aroma is dark chocolate, brown sugar & coffee. Taste is quit a bit sweet with a hint bitter & a substantial amount of alcohol heat. Flavor is dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee, vanilla & bourbon (I doubt those bourbon barrels were empty before the aging process was started). Flavors are intense & pleasing, tastes stronger than 16%. Feel is smooth & thick, almost syrupy. The low amount of carbonation is made up for with a high level of alcohol, nothing wrong with that. It doesn’t really taste like a stout, but it is delicious.",4.44
Tweak,"Pours almost black, minimal tan head that quickly fades to a small ring, no lacing but the glass retains a thin oily residue. Aroma has a little bourbon, coffee, roasted malts, cocoa, vanilla and some ash or smoke. Flavors match the aroma with a mildly boozy finish. I thought that this would be ""chewier"" but the texture is about as most BA stouts. Great flavor and aroma, surprisingly easy to drink considering everything. An awesome brew for ",4.6

Flora,Florence is probably my favorite shelf Saison beer from HF so it's no wonder this one is amazing. It takes everything from the regular and amps it up with a nice tartness and oak character. Screams that HF signature funk with a bit of lemon/lime character as well.,4.6
Flora,Wow. This is easily the best sour I've ever had. Pours bright red in the glass with a trace of head. Hill Farmstead funk without being overpowering. Loved it!!!,5
Flora,"Unsure of vintage. Poured into a HF bulb. Bright golden orange/yellow. Small head. Smells of oak and subtle funk. Some wine characteristics there as well. Flavor is so damn good. Some funk, tartness, white whine characteristics and oakiness. Amazing. Feel is spot on for the style. Lots of bubbles and very refreshing. Overall, a fantastic HF beer.

Flora,"I was extremely lucky to have been there to get this as an onsite pour. I am thankful. It was excellent. As usual, Hill Farmstead is the standard by which all breweries must measure themselves.",5
Flora,"Batch 2017. Bottled splited 4 ways. Very pale golden slighlty hazy liquid with a white head diminishing fast. Shy nose, winy, white grape, slight funk, tartness. Taste is quite disappointing, light body, light floral taste, some citrus sourness, white wine, I lot of hype around this one that I think doesn’t deserve it. Florence in my opinion deserves more respect for the taste vs price.",3.51
Flora,"This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a hazy burnt yellow to orange color with a one finger white foamy head that quickly dissipated leaving some light messy lacing sliding right on into the beer. The smell takes on a quick sour grape to bitter grapefruit and then a subtle grapefruit, semi-sweet grassy contour. Beautifully floral and then a lemony sweet to bitter aroma. The taste takes on the same aroma roaming into a florally bittersweet dry aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation runs fairly light allowing the sourness to hit as a good penetrator for the harshness. Overall, this isn't a saison but a really nice American Wild ale.",4.09

Flora,"On tap at Festival of Farmhouse Ales 2015. This was first time trying Flora (I had previously had the Blue/Black variant). While this doesn't quite reach the heights of Ann and Art, it is a tremendous barrel-aged saison. Wonderfully tart with a deep and complex flavor profile.",4.63

Flora,"A very lovely saison. It has the nice tartness that is characteristic of HF saisons, leaving a bit of a pucker but not in a dominating way. Flavour contains grape, oak, lemon and peach, with a slightly dry finish, with the oak really coming out. The mouthfeel is also terrific - nice and lively without being irritating, a softness that makes it very pleasant to drink. Hard to be too complimentary of this beer - it is a terrific example of a saison, with the yeast playing a very large role and light fruit flavours dancing about. The barrel treatment is also well done - it is notably better than Florence, which is already a very good beer. A pricy bottle but certainly worth it - I would have bought more if they let me!",4.47

Body is heavy of course and abv is a bit harsh. ,4.32

Finish is oily-smooth and yet conveys a warning note of the substantial ABV. ",4.38
Caffè Americano,"Excited to have this one after hearing about it for so long, and it did not disappoint. Foreboding opaque black with a thin oatmeal colored head. Smell hits all the right notes: espresso, huge chocolate, vanilla, barley and smooth malt. The tastes is dark and powerfully creamy, the chocolate is heavy, the espresso lifts with the vanilla, there is some nuts and caramel under the surface, and the malts don't come across as super roasted, rather they are smooth and super heavy. This beer sits in the gut like a brick, but the body is creamy, somewhat airy, and frothy",4.5
Caffè Americano,"Poured a black body with one-finger head khaki head with minor lace. Mild espresso aroma of roasted coffee with some hints of lactic quality. Smooth, thick, heavy, easy to drink, well-hidden ABV, slightly cocoa sweet and roasted (and slightly sticky) coffee taste and so easy to drink. Well-balanced beer that is a must-try.",4.2
Caffè Americano,"Pretty much exactly as advertised: a big coffee stout with complementary notes of chocolate and vanilla. Thick and viscous in the glass, has that coffee ice cream aroma shared by manny of the best new-age coffee stouts. Flavors pack a big punch of espresso and fudge. The thick, velvety, luxurious mouthfeel is definitely the high point for me. Reminds me of the mouthfeel on Trillium's pastry stouts when they are successfully executed.",4.29

Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,"Finally had a chance to try this iconic beer. As is the nature of things this beer is a huge credit to history and the early expansion of huge bitter west coast style DIPAs. Somewhat reminiscent of a Pliny, etc. Clearly remains an outstanding beer but now the bitterness and dank quality seem overstated. The creamy deep maltiness has a slight bit of a cloying and syrup. 10 years ago I would have marveled... now it seems somewhat pushy even a bit harsh in the aftertaste.",4.25
Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,"Copper colored with a very clear complexion. Moderate, soapy lacing is present. There’s a three quarter inch creamy brown head. There’s a pungent citrus aroma. I’m tasting a massively bitter tangerine and citrus forward double IPA. The mouth is resinous, dry, and crisp.",4.29

Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,Poured on draft at the Fat Head's Saloon.,4.53
Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,"Hoppy, piney extremely aromatic. Pours a rich, clear gold with a moderate white head. Great mouthfeel, significant bitterness. Even finish and excellent overall",4.74
Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,"4 pack Whole Foods in Cleveland. Pours a clear orange/light copper colour with limited off white head. Aroma dank piney, citrus, slightly floral, creeping into sweaty, but deliciously so. Taste starts sweet for a millisecond before the pine bitterness slaps you with a sticky resinous blast on the back of just a touch of caramel malt. Finishes slightly sticky with palate coating bitterness that warns against consuming anything else for a while, yet not a punishing bitter, a wondrously tasty one! Absolutely great.",4.49
Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,Poured into a snifter.,4.14
Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,L: Pours hazy golden with an inch of head that settles nicely,4.48
Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,This is up there with the best ones in my opinion. Really juicy...nice and citrusy hoppy. Just got this on tap from a brewpub while visiting my Dad and home town. I hope I can find this again up in my neck of the woods.,4.75
Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,"12oz. bottle: This one pours a slightly hazy golden color. There was a small off white head that leaves some lacing. Good hop nose. Mainly resinousy pine hops. Some tropical and citrus notes also. The taste is also very good. Resinous piney hops, along with some citrus and tropical flavors. Fairly bitter with no residual sweetness. Nice!",4.24
Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,"I received a bottle of Hop Juju in a ninja box from the Newbies! I've been looking for this one for a while, so my heart skipped around a bit when I opened the box. I always love trying new IPAs - but ones that are so highly rated, and for so long... well now.",4.4
Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,Good color and nice head rentention. For a higher ABV I don't necessarily taste the alcohol but a nice smooth beer with definite hop finish with a bit of spice. ,4.32

Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,"Brilliant copper amber body, clear with some haze from the chill. Three finger white, creamy head with some serious staying power. Nice sticky, web-like lace.",4.63
Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,"Bright copper orange in color with perfect clarity. Poured with a short, creamy, white foam that reduced to soapy cap with medium low retention. Medium bodied with medium light carbonation. Boozy warmth intensifies through the middle and turned a little prickly toward the finish. Medium spicy hop aromas with light citrus notes and an underlying dankness. Medium malt and caramel aromas with and sweet, boozy notes toward the end. Medium high spicy and citrus hop flavors up front with caramel maltiness. Medium high, spicy and pine bitterness through the middle. Herbal and spicy hop flavors with expanding booziness and caramel malt notes from the middle to the end. Finished semi-dryly with lingering pine hop bitterness and sweet caramel malt notes. Well balances intense hop and malt character. Hop aromas and flavors are solid and bitterness is intense but not overwhelming. A NE IPA this is not. A great old school west coast IPA, intense, hoppy and tasty.",4.37
Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,This beer has a thin off white head to a beautifully clear golden clear beer. ,4.35
Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,"12oz bottled 2/12/18 (19 days ago) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass at fridge temp 9% ABV 100 IBU. The beer pours bright golden amber with sticky off white head. Retention and lacing are above average. The aroma is tropical fruit, citrus and earth. The taste is earthy, with tropical highlights and citrus rind. No trace of 9% ABV in the aroma or taste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, adequately carbonated and dry in the finish. To have this much feel and taste without ever going sweet or sticky is masterful. Overall, excellent. Recommended!",4.54
Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,Appearance - Pour crystal clear amber color with huge fluffy white head that will not go away. Lots of spotty lacing around the glass.,4.49
Hop JuJu Imperial IPA,This beer is nearly perfect. Excellent IPA. It has a very smooth almost gentle finish compared to some other IPAs. Golden Amber in color. It has a great head on the pour. Quite excellent,4.79
Second Fiddle,"This is becoming more readily available in restaurants. I have had this on draft and never been disappointed! Excellent aroma and taste, one of my go to's when available.",4.82
Second Fiddle,"After a quick stop at The Alchemist yesterday (07SEP19) for a few cans I stopped into The Reservoir in Waterbury for some libations. Started off with an 11oz pour of this, for $6.50.",4.25
Second Fiddle,"From the can, it pours a lovely clear golden amber with a nice white head that eventually diminishes to a thin layer. In the nose, it is a mad forlorn hope of citrus and some pine in the assault! In the mouth, it is the same: grapefruit and citrus, along with a bit of bitter and malt. Yum!",4.51
Second Fiddle,"It's getting harder to rate IPAs these days because good IPAs are getting more plentiful and easier to find. The taste profiles are also catching up to the point where it's difficult to distinguish the better ones. To me, a few IPAs stand out and this stands up well against Heady Topper or Lawson's Sip of Sunshine.",4.79
Second Fiddle,"The aroma explodes of juicy mangoes, peaches, oranges. Just sweet nectar and fruity.",4.38
Second Fiddle,"Big juicy crusher. Floral, citrus, dank, earthy, bready, wine grapes, really nice carb, smooth, light and easy drinking at 8.2%. Great beer, stacks up well with it’s better known neighbors.",4.5
Second Fiddle,"Canned 4/29. Light gold, slightly hazy. Smells juicy, some hops. Taste is juicy, hoppy, citrus, pineapple, peach. Medium mouthfeel with a dry, puckering finish. Slight bitterness. Almost perfectly balanced and totally crushable. I gotta get me some more of this stuff.",4.59
Second Fiddle,"Unlike the Fiddlehead IPA, which tastes more unique, Second Fiddle hits all the typical NEDIPA notes for taste. That doesn’t mean it isn’t delicious. Not a hazy look or heavy feel. Get some.",4.32
Second Fiddle,Canned on 3/6/19,4.07
Second Fiddle,"This is an excellent DIPA. The initial sip hits the pallet with incredible balance and finishes with the bitter hoppy taste. Each sip thereafter finishes better and better. If you can find it, buy it, and enjoy it.",4.53
Second Fiddle,A really good IPA,4.45
Second Fiddle,Now this is an oldschool IPA - and one that I haven't previously reviewed. I was mightily psyched for this check-in.,4.27
Second Fiddle,"Very good VT style IPA - similar to Heady Topper and Lawson's Finest Sip of Sunshine. Pours golden orage with tastes of grapefruit, pine, and other citrus fruit. Good bitterness in the finish.",4.31
Second Fiddle,"16 oz can, dated 1/31/19 so about 3 weeks old",4.05
Second Fiddle,"Modest finger deep head, just off-white, even surface, few dimples, retention is good for what’s there initially, lacing starts out as wide sheets eventually breaking into thinner streaks. Soft gauziness to the liquid but nowhere near filmy or cloudy, bright golden color, noticeably dispersed tiny bubbles, like gentle snowflakes just, err, going up. Honeyed nose, tangerine to pink grapefruit and lime, citrus a major component, fresh unbaked pie crust, pine sap, coal tar, starts heading in a dank direction and suddenly stops, this allows the pineapple, apricot, green melon scents to spread some, not fully tropical in nature. Full-bodied, dry mouth entry, almost scrubbing in feel, the carbonation active with more prickle than creaminess. The breadiness more toasty and here the tarriness sinks in deeper. White pepper and a light salinity take the sappy goodness out of the pine notes. Somehow the pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus gets pushed back to past the mid-palate, the carbonation churns it away. Papaya, pineapple, green apple to nectarine fruit, here it’s just the dryness which has it come off as not that tropical. Overall, there’s a lot going on and it never loses your attention. That said, could wish for more smooth integration.",4.04
Second Fiddle,Was given one by a friend. Loved it. Another friend had one of my all time favorites Sip of Sunshine with him. This was every bit as enjoyable. Both same price. I can’t favor one over the other. They are 2 of my top 3 NEIPA. The other being Focal Banger. Heady Toppers little brother. HT is number 4 for me. I live in Central VT and have easy access to all of them. Second Fiddle will be my go to beer of choice because it’s new to me,4.77
Second Fiddle,"Picked-up a four-pack @ Portside Liquors in Plymouth, MA for about seventeen dollars. My second brew from these guys, who I think are new to MA. Solid, if unspectacular brew.",4.25
Second Fiddle,Look is an opaque honey orange and poured with 2 fingers of fluffy white head.,4.46
Second Fiddle,"I'm told this outstanding DIPA from Fiddlehead Brewing in Shelburne, VT is very tough to get outside the Burlington area. In that regard--and in others--it compares well with the legendary Heady Topper. Big, three fingered head, incredible nose loaded with citrus and pine and dangerously drinkable at 8.2%, this is an outstanding example of the now-revered NEIPA style. (It also helps to explain why that style is now-revered and wildly popular.) ",4.71

Second Fiddle,16 oz beer poured into a nonic pint glass canned on the 9/18.,3.98
Second Fiddle,"Six weeks from canning... Orange haze, perfectly uniform throughout, nice lacing. Smells like melons, taste is a little more piney/dank than expected, but it works nice. Good feel, nice brew",4.52
Second Fiddle,A: Pours a lightly hazy orange color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a nice cap that leaves good lacing,4.48
Second Fiddle,"Almost clear golden color with off-white head. Aroma has resiny, piney hops with a sweet malt background. Taste starts bitter upfront, slightly astringent, quite harsh and resiny. Medium plus body with medium carbonation. I expected much more from this one considering the hype but it's a quite basic DIPA with intense bitterness and not much complexity.",3.75

Fort Point Pale Ale,"
Overall: Very good brew and borderline IPA like. I say grab it, Salud!",4.12
Fort Point Pale Ale,"Traded for this a while ago, as the date on the bottom of the can read 1/24/17 with ""HOW ABOUT NO"" written below that. It's easy to see how this would be Trillium's flagship offering as this was quite heavy, dank, and tasty at the same time, while being a good example of what an American Pale Ale should be. Even though this can was two years old, it aged well and had very little sediment in it, as the flavors held up quite well over time!",4.25
Fort Point Pale Ale,"This is a very good beer. A few years ago, I would have said ""Amazing."" With what we're finding at other breweries, I'd buy it if I were local, but wouldn't go out of my way.",4.38
Fort Point Pale Ale,16oz can - Double Dry Hopped version,3.73
Fort Point Pale Ale,A-Hazy pineapple juice look with a nice head that dissipates quickly ,5
Fort Point Pale Ale,"Pours a murky orange that glows like a Dragonball when held up to the light. Snow-white foam tops out at just over a finger after a modest pour, and retains well. Aroma is orange, tangerine, papaya, and pineapple form a smashing, but not brutal or harsh, tropical fruit display. It smells a little sweet. Toasty biscuit, wheat, and bread malt notes help bring down the sugary citrus rush. Flavor profile is papaya, tangerine, orange, and mango with a hit of toasty biscuit, and bready malt notes. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a fuzzy, nearing-on-velvety texture at the onset and then thins out on the tongue. It has a middle of the road consistency. Overall, a flavorful American Pale Ale, although it really drinks like any other NE IPA just with a little more malt at the forefront. Knocked down 1/4 of a point for that. The malt balance here helps counteract the sugary hop pull most NE IPAs carry, landing this one at a very favorable balance.",4.38
Fort Point Pale Ale,"From the 16 oz. can which was canned 09/13/18. Sampled on September 27, 2018.",4.31
Fort Point Pale Ale,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass, sure why not. Canned July 24th 2018.",4.05
Fort Point Pale Ale,"Pours a hazy peach coloration with a small, fizzy head. Smell is initially quite lovely, with hoppy, juicy tropical/citrus fruit notes of mango and passion fruit with a hint of pineapple and tangerine, but takes on a light cat piss note as it sits. Taste is very bright and hoppy, dominated sweet, juicy tropical fruit notes of mango, passion fruit and pineapple and with zesty citrus notes of grapefruit and tangerine. There's a light dankness and a hint of pine to this as well, almost no malt presence detectable though. Finishes with a light bitterness and very mild hop burn. Soft mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation. This is the quintessential NE style Pale Ale and I would say that it has an amazing juicy hoppiness, mouthfeel and depth of flavour for a Pale Ale, BUT is this even a Pale Ale at 6.6% ABV? Nonetheless, it's still an excellent beer at a relatively low ABV. The balance of sweet tropical fruit, zesty citrus fruit and dankness/pine really is outstanding here.",4.38
Fort Point Pale Ale,"The first thing I said when I tasted this beer was ""pineappley goodness"", and I'll stick to that. The overwhelming flavor of this beer is certainly what you notice, but behind that, it's actually pretty balanced. I thought it was a bit less hazy than most of the recent ""New England-style"" beers, but I get why this is their main APA, and I'd bet it is one of their two or three biggest sellers too.",4

Fort Point Pale Ale,Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a conical pint glass; canned on 10/18/17. ,4.22
Fort Point Pale Ale,"The beer is a hazy, bright, yellow-gold coloring that is almost opaque, with a frothy, foamy, bright white head that sits low profile and doesn't appear to be going anywhere. Aromas of citrus initially, with a grassy undertone that anchors the nose a bit. Flavors are a citrus blast on the forward tongue, followed by a subtle biscuit backbone that balances well. Lemon and tangerine dance across the palate with every sip, and there is a grassy and peppery blend to keep the sweetness in check. Smooth, mid-bodied, with light, almost effervescence into the aftertaste of citrus sweetness. Slick, clean, slightly dry finish that leaves some citrusy linger behind. Easy drinker but just okay for me. Review may have been influenced by drinking a Cutting Tiles DIPA prior to this.",3.75
Fort Point Pale Ale,Bought one at the brewery and had to check my luggage to get it and 10 various others home.,4.35
Fort Point Pale Ale,Cloudy straw appearance with slight whit head. Mild hoppy aroma with a touch of citrus. Taste is definitely pleasant citrus first with a hint of hoppyness,4.52
Fort Point Pale Ale,"Very enjoyable DDH pale ale. Perfect balance but it definitely taste more like an IPA. Citrusy, grapefruit, and mango. Medium bitterness, yet very smooth.",4.29
Fort Point Pale Ale,"I've had the Enigma-hopped variant, but boy howdy, I surely prefer the original - beautiful, creamy head, wonderfully hazy and juicy. This exemplifies what I love about NE IPAs. I'd happily drink this for about 50% of the rest of my life. Then if I could have Abraxas or Vanilla Noir for the other 50%, life would be good.",5

Tastes like dark cherry, dark fruit, chocolate, caramel, nutty roasted malts, coffee, toasted bread, maple syrup, vanilla, bourbon, oak barrel, mild smoke, hint of coconut, graham cracker, maple toast, with earthy hops to balance.

Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"375 ml bottle into snifter, 2017 vintage bottling. Pours opaque dark brown/black color with a small fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin spotty lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, maple syrup, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, fudge, marshmallow, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, and dark/brown bread; with light notes of coconut, coffee, molasses, licorice, raisin, plum, fig, cherry, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Touch of booze in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, maple syrup, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, maple syrup, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, fudge, marshmallow, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, and dark/brown bread; with light notes of coconut, coffee, molasses, licorice, raisin, plum, fig, cherry, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Mild herbal, roast, char bitterness; and bourbon/oak tannin spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, maple syrup, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, fudge, marshmallow, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, dark/brown bread, light dark fruit/smoke/char, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, maple syrup, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a solid roast/hop bitter/sweet, and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with no cloying/acrid flavors after the finish. Slightly increasing dryness from lingering hop/char bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety, and lightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is fantastic. Mildly increasing warmth of 12.1%, with minimal barrel booze lingering after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic BBA imperial porter! All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, maple syrup, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to drip on for the big ABV, with the mildly bitter/tannic/drying finish. Amazingly rich/well rounded malt complexity and maple syrup presence; with perfect barrel integration/balance. Not overly roasty/charred on malts, or boozy on barrels. A highly enjoyable offering, and spot on style example as expected.",4.25

Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,"I'd been looking forward to this for quite a while and, although there were some unexpected things about it, it didn't disappoint. Poured from a 12.7 ounce 2017 bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip. Very dark brown color (would've said black but near the end you can see it's brown) with a small beige head. Smell has a very strong bourbon presence and a sweetness but not specifically maple. Ditto on the taste but with some vanilla and dark chocolate notes.

Nose is dominated by raspberry. Also getting really nice notes of vanilla, funk, oak, and raisin. Taste is mouth puckering sour upfront. Wow! Tart, sour, raspberry, tree, oak, vanilla, yeast, and maybe a bit of sherry. The taste lingers on the aftertaste for quite some time. Such a gorgeous mouthfeel - somewhat dry.

Coolship Red,"Been hunting this one for years. As Captain Ahab quipped, ""this is what ye have shipped for men! To chase that white whale on both sides of the land, over all sides of the earth!"" Beautiful ruby red pour that glowed in the sunlight, with no head after initial surface carbonation. Smell was the star: deep raspberry both fresh skins and sour insides, beautiful oak full of character, wheat, vanilla, wild flower, wild belgian yeast, apricot, and red wine barrel influences. Taste is way more subtle, but not really any less complex or beautiful, just wanted a little more bite like the belgian lambics do on the finish. Simultaneously vinous, sweet, tart, boozy and funky. Well worth the hunt, but does not compete with the belgian lambics of fame",4.38

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Description: Appearance is glassy and black with a small amount of dark, tan foam. Smell is deep and rich, with cinnamon and chilies dominating. Chocolate, vanilla and bourbon are also evident, providing for a complex aroma. The taste carries the same cinnamon and chilies, but they are extremely prevalent, to the point that the bourbon, chocolate and other underlying flavors are drowned out. It’s a hot, spicy and slightly bitter finish that doesn’t keep up with the richness of the smell. Feel is a little thin for a stout with low carbonation as can be expected.",4
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"I finally got to try Bourbon Barrel Aged Oro Negro and it was great. It lived up to the hype. It is brewed with Walnuts, conditioned on spices and Aged in Bourbon Barrels. What an explosion of flavors. It is a wonderful stout.",4.65
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Jet black with a two finger head, cinnamon is certainly present along with cacao and a little vanilla. I get the touch of heat but booze as well. The two together make this complex but a too much so, it doesn't jive for me the way other Jackie's do, but it is still quite drinkable and so I will.",4.49

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Drank from a 12.7 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA",4.45
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"2018 vintage - Pours black with a fairly dense creamy tan foam head. The smell of this beer from the bottle was an amazing sensory experience. It is reminiscent of something like a dark chocolate covered toasted brown bread with a dash of cinnamon on top. In the glass aromas of creamy vanilla and sweet cinnamon hit up front with a habanero pepper spice laying beneath, with rich dark chocolate, toasty brown bread, walnuts, oak barrel, some bourbon, caramel, toffee, candied dark fruits, and some earthy pine. The flavor is a blast of equal proportions. Rich dark chocolate, cinnamon, habanero pepper spice, creamy vanilla, toasted brown bread, walnuts, oak, bourbon, caramel, toffee, candied dark fruits, and some earthy piney hops to balance. Feels lighter medium bodied, creamy smooth with moderate carbonation. Overall a real great bourbon barrel aged imperial stout.",4.9
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,L — Pours a pitch black body with a scant half finger of light brown head. Minimal retention and lacing ,4.52
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Not Shure why some ratings are low. This bottle was from a trade as an extra and stayed in the stash for a while so it has been aged. Definitely not the""hot mess"" I have seen some reviewers describe.",4.41
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"375 ml bottle into snifter, 2017 vintage bottling. Pours opaque dark brown/black color with a 1 finger dense and rocky tan head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, walnuts, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, fudge, marshmallow, vanilla, cream, cinnamon, habanero pepper, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark/brown bread; with light notes of coconut, molasses, licorice, raisin, fig, date, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Touch of booze in the aromas as it warmed, but not overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, walnuts, spices, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, walnuts, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, fudge, marshmallow, vanilla, cream, cinnamon, habanero pepper, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark/brown bread; with light notes of coconut, molasses, licorice, raisin, fig, date, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Mild herbal/roast/char bitterness, and bourbon/oak/pepper/cinnamon spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, walnuts, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, fudge, marshmallow, vanilla, cream, cinnamon, habanero pepper, bourbon, toasted oak, dark/brown bread, light dark fruit/smoke/char, leather, tobacco, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, walnuts, spices, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet and spiciness balance; with no cloying/acrid/astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and bourbon/oak/spiciness. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety, and lightly sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is fantastic. Mildly increasing warmth of 12.1% and pepper heat; with minimal barrel booziness lingering after the finish. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged imperial spiced stout! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, walnuts, spices, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the big ABV, with the mildly bitter/spicy/drying finish. Amazingly rich malt complexity, perfectly balanced spices, and bourbon barrel presence/integration. Not overwhelming on any aspect. A bit more soft and mellowed out on spice after the barrel aging. A highly enjoyable offering as expected. Liked it just a bit more than the base beer.",4.35

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Pours a jet black with a tight light tan head. Nose is of spices. Cinnamon, a bit of heat and dark roasted malts. Taste is extremely mellow. I mean that in a good way. This is a extremely easy drinking and pleasant beer for being a BA Imperial Stout. Notes of roasted malt, black coffee, caramel, candied bourbon, cinnamon and vanilla. Finished of with a slightest touch of heat from the peppers and bourbon heat. A little nuttiness in there as well. Silky medium to full body with a bit of chewiness to it. Really enjoyed this one. It’s smooth!",4.43
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"2017 16.9 ounce bottle poured into tulip. After a somewhat heavy pour, there was minimal head. Like just a small tan ring of medium bubbles, not impressive on first impression. Dark as night body. Chocolate, coffee, roast and walnut finish on the nose. Taste is where this shines! Dark chocolate, smooth bourbon and wood, mild cinnamon, dark fruits, vanilla. Building spice from the habanero but I'm not deterred. Big, chewy body with easy drinkability.",4.38

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Jet black, tan head a few random gobs of lacing left behind. The smell is loaded with bourbon, oak, vanilla molasses, habaneros and chocolate. The flavor is very sweet up front with some oak and bourbon. This gives way to some chocolate vanilla and molasses. There is a char bitterness and the flavor of the peppers at the end. Finishes with a nice little heat. This is a damn fine beer.",4.6
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"High expectation and kind of a mess in delivery. I got some notes of oxidation, more than I am comfortable with. Among the very pleasant vanilla spice notes was a subtle vegetal note from the chilis. I think my preference lies in the base beer.",3.93
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Black color with mocha head. Aroma has intense bourbon, butterscotch and caramel with some spices on top.

Really tasty but quite hot from the chillies and the bourbon.",4.6

Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Pours an opaque brownish black color with quickly dissipating tan head and fair amount of residual lacing.Nose is very mild chocolate sweetness ,a bit of bourbon barrel and a touch of honey. Taste follows nose ,feels a bit on the thin side. Not quite a disappointment, but not the best value. Definitely a one and done, mainly due to cost.There are a whole lotta BA stouts out there for way less $$ that easily give this a run for the money.Don't get me wrong ,this is very,very good -just way over priced.",4.39

Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),Solid stout here. Nice head and lace. The base beer is good enough. I don't get a great deal of smooth barrel here. Has a little bite. After taste is so so. I had another version a while ago that was much better. Can't remember the wax color.,3.78
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),Pours a dark chocolate color. Aroma is mellow barrel with a touch of Carmel vanilla boozines. Flavor follows the nose. Nice chocolate with some char and a good Carmel vanilla bourbon flavor. A little thin but overall fantastic.,4.44
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),Drank the 2012 bottle...Not sure how this one has not fallen off the BA Top 250 list. It was a solid BA Stout but I have had dozens of BA stouts that were better than this one. I recently had the Pappy Eclipse and it was better than this one. Shared with friends recently at a small share. Who knows...maybe the 2012 sat too long,4.28
Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Nice looking beer with a nearly opaque color and a nice foamy tan head that lingered. Whiskey, coffee, cocoa, and caramel on the nose. The taste was a bit too much whiskey for me, but there was a nice sweetness and roastiness from the honey to balance things out. Not overly cloying, but essentially two dominant aspects (whiskey and honey) that battle it out. Definitely not subtle.",4.17

Juicy,"The beer pours a some what Clear copper orange with a large fluffy white head. It has medium high carbonation. The beer smells of kiwi, white grape gooseberry, white wine, orange marmalade, and grapefruit. It tastes of kiwi, gooseberry, white grape, white wine, orange marmalade, and barnyard funk. The feel is light and juicy. This is an amazing wine ba saison, it’s tropical, juicy, and funky.",4.74
Juicy,"Hazy orange color with off-white head. Aroma has tart fruits, fermented notes, herbs and a bit of fruit vinegar. Taste is balanced, fruity, mineral with bitter fruit pits and almonds. Medium body with low carbonation. Quite nice wild ale with lots of farmhouse funk and fruit flavors.",4.3
Juicy,"375 mL bottle from December 2016. Decanted carefully in case of sediment, Juicy pours an orange-copper with a thin layer of head from bubbles that rise up in a curiously slow way, as if the liquid is more viscous than it otherwise seems. Beautiful aromas of white wine, apple cider vinegar, papaya, honeydew melon, and orange blossom. The perfect amount of bright acidity on the tongue, enough to get the salivary glands pumping but not so much as to overwhelm the delicate complexity of flavors on parade here. I'm loving the influence of the wine barrels.",4.32

Juicy,"Nice bit of Brett on the nose. Bigger, bolder body than many HF base saisons. Sweetness is matched by the Brett and wine character. White grape. Some fruit cocktail juiciness. Lower carb than typical. Balanced notes from the barrel, Brett, and fruit flavors. Guessing the fruit comes from the barrel and maybe hops. Very interesting beer and quite delicious.",4.64

Juicy,"Pleasantly surprised on how much of a treat this was. Big thanks to VermontHiker. This was not at all what I expected, completely surprised me and the nose was really something to behold. Bottle date 2015 on this one, need a fresh bottle to see what all this time did to it. A lot of bread, grapes, grass, wine and hop bitterness in both nose and taste. The wine barrels seemingly diminish whatever profound tartness wants to come out and punch you in the jaw. I'll drink this again and again and again. This is a beer I'd like to drink every weekday on warm summer nights....for one must know how to make use of their stupidity as much as of their fire. JUICY!",4.56
Juicy,This was an excellent saison that I could drink forever. Very smooth and delicious. Reminded me of champagne almost with the wine flavors coming through and the great base saison coming together.,4.51

Juicy,Nose is tropical brett and a little back end funk. The palate is really clean slight tart finish plenty of sweet citrus and tropical fruit notes.. Damn good beer really clean and palateable.,4.66
Juicy,"an extremely impressive little bottle of saison here, wonderfully hoppy and wild, and quite literally juicy in its overall complexion. pale and bright on the pour, fizzy at first but settling back quickly, less hazy than anticipated, but not all the way clear, lots of little bubbles rising up. the aroma forces an almost smelling salts sort of response from me, with an involuntary jerk back of the head, whew this is pungent. right away i get strong wine tannins, a mature bretty funk the gives to a lambic sort of oaky sourness, and of course the unmistakable new zealand hops, which seem dry hoppy right away. my mouth waters like i cant remember, so i set right in on the first swig. a big whoosh of carbonation takes the beer right to the roof of the mouth and back of the tongue, the whole palate is getting in on this right from the get go. amazing wild yeast complexion, thats what i love most about this one, super funky farmy brett with soft green apple, meyer lemon, and even white grape notes, dry but sort of richer or more complete of a brett spectrum than most, but this sort of moves into a more bacterial citric pucker, also mature and fully wild, like real lambic, it certainly has that almost medicinal start and the inoculated woody later bit, its certainly at least that complex. the hops are fruity too, pineapple comes to mind, more white wine. the wood is soft, the mouthfeel is aided by that, and its flavor is as woody as it is winey, with a nice herbal botanical input from the hops at its peak. tangy and sour, but not so much so that we didnt wish this came in a three liter bottle, my whole palate wanted the whole bottle, but i felt compelled to share it. highly carbonated and fuller bodied, but delicate in its overall presentation. dry but not all the way. one of the better and more nuanced but also aggressively flavored hill farmstead beers i have had, truly distinct and memorable, i can still taste it even. this is about as much as you can do with brett saison, especially for not having fruit in it, an enormously delicious beer. huge thanks to my trading buddy back east!",4.54
Juicy,"Batch 3 shared on 3-4-16. Pours on the darker side of yellow. Pretty hazy. Juicy is a great description of the beer overall, because that is what I got from nose to finish. A sweet tangelo like presence on the nose, followed by a melon like sweetness on the palate with a slight bitter and juicy finish. Really well made beer.",4.49
Juicy,Pours a light amber carbonated color. Aroma is tart funky and I think I get citrus. Flavor follows the nose. Flavor is delicious. Some tarness a little funk ang definitely juiciness. Nice feel and overall this is fantastic.,4.56

Thicket,"Had at a beer share with 2 good friends a few months ago. We had been trying to acquire this for a long time, we finally tracked it down and it was worth the wait!",5
Thicket,"Pours a beatufil purple with minimal lacing. Smell is of sour blackberry - sour coming from lacto, I am assuming. The blackberry is so strong. Taste follows the nose, strong sour blackberry flavor with a decently sharp acidity. Feel is super bubbly/effervescent. Very clean on the pallet. Overall, it is probably the best blackberry sour I have had, but falls well short of smooth and fuzzy",4.34
Thicket,"poured from a 375mL bottle into a wine glass. pours a beautiful dark red with pinkish white head. smells of blackberry jam with some acidic funk. taste is similar with the jamminess taking the forefront. this is some tart cider! sour and acidic. feel is appropriate for the style. not overly bubbly. definitely on the thicker side of things. overall, damn sour but one of my favorites of the SP 375s.",4.6
Thicket,L: clearish red with no head. ,4.5
Thicket,"A: A deep red, almost purple. White head that sticks for a while. S: Blackberries and a lot of them. Oak, hay, lemon zest, vinegar. T: Yep that's perfect. Juicy blackberries, tart blackberries. Some oak to dry the back end and that signature SP tartness/sour to let you know it means business. M: Enough carb to make it palatable, but not a lot to make it soft. Oak dryness on the backend end. O: This is killer. I've had a few SP bottles now and this one is amazing. Not the most sour of the bunch, but very complex and well balanced",4.77
Thicket,Appearance: Pours auburn brown with a modest head; decent retention,4.24
Thicket,"Incredible beer. Thanks to @jdhowe for the share. Beautiful purplish hue with strong blackberry aroma. Very sour, but not too acidic. A little funk, but probably more on the nose. Delicious beer.",4.78

Thicket,Thanks to Kyle,4.62
Thicket,"In my opinion, the least acidic, most fruit forward of the Side Project 375ml bottles. For me, it was also the easiest to drink, along with Blancs. Tons of mildly tart blackberries, with lots of blackberry skin noticeable throughout the beer. The oak presence is very noticeable with a hint of red wine. This was a fantastic.",4.67
Thicket,Pours a dark burgundy with slight head that fades quickly and minimal lacing. Aroma hits right away with fresh sour blackberries and red wine. The taste follows the nose. There's a bit of lemon and some red wine vinegar along with a buttery component that comes through as it warms. Mouth feel is light to medium. Very good overall. Glad I got to try this.,4.25
Thicket,"Pours a light reddish brown body with slight pink hues, half finger white head with surprisingly good retention time, nice lacing. Smells of tart lactic acidity, blackberry puree. Mild grainy malt sweetness in the background, but make no mistake, the acidity and the blackberry are the stars here. Although, the blackberry is certainly playing second fiddle to the lacto and acetic acid. Flavour is surprisingly less sour than expected, e.g. La Fosse, and the blackberries kick in towards the end. For the most part, it's oak, a bit of hay, a lot of lactic and acetic acid contributing a strong sense of sourness. The blackberries start to come into their own halfway in, and leave you with a mild jammy flavour at the end. The tartness never recedes but is rather constant. Still, it's a tasty beer and is far easier to drink than La Fosse. Overall, a very nice blackberry wild, but it lacks a good bit of complexity for the most part. It's acidic with a moderate blackberry presence, that's pretty much all she wrote.",4.24
Thicket,One of my favorite side project beers. Still had that typical Side Project lacto but the fruit comes through in this one much more than a lot of their other beers.,4.71
Thicket,375 mL bottle poured into a snifter.,3.95
Thicket,"Appearance: Beautiful dark blackberry juice. Medium size head due to the high carbonation (starting in the bottle once I cracked the cap). I was afraid I was in for a ""gusher"" but it held off.",4.43
Thicket,Poured into a Side Project stem from a 375ml bottle. Purchased at release.,4.9
Thicket,"Pours thick and opaque with a high effervescence and no head. It is a rich purple and looks like homemade blackberry jam. Smell is like other Side Project fruited sours: large amounts of fresh ripe fruit (in this case, blackberries) and a lacto yogurty sourness. In this case, the fruit shine over the lacto. Taste is extremely sour but not as sour as Fencerow or Fuzzy. Tastes like unsweetened yogurt with fresh tart blackberries. A defined sour acidity lingers on the aftertaste with a hint of red wine tannins. Mouthfeel is well carbed and very dry. Overall, a fantastic beer that balances the fruit and sourness better than every other SP fruited sour other than Blanc.",4.62
Thicket,"My 2000th rating! Served at cellar temp, and poured into my HF oversized wine glass.",4.62
Thicket,375ml bottle poured into a large stem.,4.87
Thicket,"Beautiful color, head fades quickly. Nose is muted. Harsh sourness, slight buttery aroma / flavor (not unpleasant - perhaps just a barrel note), some acetone / nail polish. The fruit flavor, while authentic, wasn't deep. Little funky or character outside of acidity, touch of fruit, some wine butteriness. Consumed at the same time as several De Garde lambic based beers - The Lucy, The Lily - and this couldn't hold a candle to them ... and I say this as someone who finds Side Project saisons about as good as saisons get.",4.13
Thicket,Poured into a tulip. Pours a gorgeous dark burgundy. The nose is just killer on this one with a very unique barnyard character along with dark berries. The flavor is super jammy tart blackberry. Just a wonderfully crafted sour.,4.81
Thicket,"Bottle courtesy of Joe, just like every other good beer I rate here. Poured to a Cantillon taster. Pours dark purple and slightly murkey with a beautiful bubbly pinkish purple head on top that fizzes away after a minute or two. Super funky aroma, with vinegar and barnyard, serious dry oakiness, and a bit of jammy berry. Flavor is very fruit forward with lots of jammy raspberries, but then the puckering sour hits your tongue and follows all the way down the throat. Acidic and lambic like, dry oak flavors, lacto like crazy, and finishes puckering and dry. Somehow the fruit still shines here, though. Dry, medium light bodied, with spritzy carbonation. This is good stuff for sure.",4.63
Thicket,"A- Pours a fairly dark purple in color, basically the color of crushed blackberries. The pour is rather effervescent and gives the beer a small and bubbly head about 1cm thick. Retention is very good for such a small head, and also laces decently. The body is dark enough that it can't be seen through, but when light strikes the beer, it is hazy .",4.42
Space Trace,"Nice looking stout. Smell is of bourbon, sweetness, and coconut. Taste follows the nose, nice rich flavor with bourbon and coconut dominating the palate. Some roastiness. Coats the tounge nice but slightly thin and is a little over carbed. Overall good coconut stout. The coconut could be stronger",4.2
Space Trace,This beer is a coconut bomb! So good to go with the shavings. Would drink this everyday if the week if I could. Amazing stout for sure. Gotta get more.,4.64
Space Trace,2018 bottle poured into large snifter,3.69
Space Trace,"This beer is throwing me for a loop. Second time I am trying space trace but first time writing a review and it tastes more like FO than a chocolate coconut beer. Pours thick and dark with a good amount of carbonation for the style. Leaves a layer of foam covering the surface of the beer. You get an overwhelming vanilla note on the nose. A little bit of chocolate on the back end and a generally sweet character. Coconut doesn’t really stand out however. The taste is sweet and balanced and follows the nose with chocolate becoming more prevalent as it warms. A touch too carbonated for the style but not overtly so. Another hit from bottle logic. Nice barrel, sweet, balanced and utterly delicious.",4.78
Space Trace,"2018 Bottle. Typical deep dark brown-black appearance with minimal foam around only edge of glass. Very nicely balanced sweet taste up front, with coconut coming out towards the end (and especially so as it warms). There's a good amount of chocolate presence here as well. Bourbon and booziness are well integrated also. Really good mouthfeel. Leaves the lips sticky after a few sips. ",4.47
Space Trace,"Space Trace is one of two beers procured by friends who wanted to help me out after my Dark Lord bottles were stolen. I don't know how they made this happen - something about New Glarus Strawberry Rhubarb bottles - but, I love Bottle Logic, and I was ecstatic to have the opportunity to try Space Trace.",4.64
Space Trace,"Can a playa be blunt? Off the f-ing hook. Like Captain Hook on acid, this one is bat sh-t wild! Heavy, I mean heavy! (Like Oprah) but oh so smooth like Barbara Palvin in a 2 piece. I mean ay fu-king ay! Yes!",4.5

Space Trace,"Slick motor oil black with a loud, dark mocha fizz that quickly dies off to nothing but a faint ring and never returns. Some oily specks decorate the surface thereafter.",4.03
Space Trace,"Coconut snowflakes float along the surface of this pitch black beer. Thin, brown bubbles quickly retreat to the sides of the glass. Aroma is coconut cream, chocolate brownie, toffee candy, and bourbon soaked oak. Taste is more bourbon forward. Its a big, full bourbon flavor that seems to be evidence of time spent in the barrel. Rich dark fruit, vanilla, and toasted coconut reminiscent of the best bcbs vintages. It has some roast and smoke to it and that adds character. Coconut butter cream frosting is the icing on this chocolate cake. Mouth feel is full and carbonation is on point. This is almost a 4.75, but I prefer to see the base beer come through a little more. This is excellent and well worth the cost to acquire.",4.62
Space Trace,Pours dark black with quickly dissipating head.,4.25
Space Trace,"Pitch black with fast fading head, great cocoa and vanilla nose, and massive cocoa flavor. Coconut seems to hide out in the background. Nice full and smooth as silk mouthfeel ... so bottle logic!",4.63
Space Trace,Poured from a 16oz bottle into a Bottle Logic snifter. Acquired in a trade. ,4.6
Space Trace,"Poured into a BL FO glass. Nose is caramel, toffee, vanilla, chocolate fudge, and coconut of course. All of these flavors coat the palate as well. Full and flavorful, with plenty of coconut still present. My main complaint is that the fudge component dominates too much; it has a heavy, gooey mouthfeel and flavor that impedes the barrel characteristics. Still a nice beer though.",4.18
Space Trace,Had the 2016 bottle,4.27
Space Trace,"A: Pours black, but had hazy oily finish on top... Ended up with stout snot in 3rd pour from glass.",4.67
Space Trace,"Like a liquid mounds bar. The aromas are subtle, but definitely there from the glass. The magic really happens on the palette. The chocolate and coconut come through perfectly and are backed up by the smooth base beer. Barrel comes though, but only just enough to complement the beer and bring everything together.",4.66
Space Trace,2016 vintage.,4.68
Space Trace,"Thick pour, fizzy, head fades super fast, no lacing, and pitch black. Strong aromas of bourbon, chocolate, and coconut. Notes of chocolate candy, bourbon, barrel, coconut, vanilla and chocolate liquor. Thick, smooth, no heat. Extremely solid stout with great flavors and perfect balance.",4.52
Space Trace,"Poured from the bottle into a taster. The definitely of a coconut bomb, with what appears to be flaked coconut floating on the top of my pour. A bit boozy, which negatively distracts from the overall experience.",4.39
Space Trace,"Yeah this Space Trace is like straight up ""i'm a fuck you in the ass with a coconut""... and being tipsy, i oblige, etc etc, am I at 150 characters yet?",4.63
Space Trace,"Thanks to a generous trade buddy I was fortunate to get a bottle of this. Probably one of, if not the, best barrel aged beer with coconut I've ever had. The coconut blended well with all the over flavors and barrel instead of sticking out as it's own taste. Incredibly smooth and just an overall fantastic beer.",4.86
Sang Noir,2014 vintage; drank 10/29/15 @ Fischman's. ,4.42
Sang Noir,750ml bottle. Caged and corked bottle. 2014 Project Vintage.,4.48
Sang Noir,"Pours essentially like a wine - deep purple, no head, very mild carbonation. Aroma is predominantly a gentle, dry red wine tannin with notes of wet oak, macerated dark cherries & some very subtle bourbon caramel that adds depth. The notes were right on but I felt it could have been a bit more expressive. ",4.62
Sang Noir,Maybe this will grow on me but initial impression is too tart and acidic. I prefer a duchess de bourgeouene or however TF its spelled. I guess I'm a sour rookie.,4.15
Sang Noir,10oz pour into a snifter,4.66
Sang Noir,"Enjoyed after a nice rest in the cellar. Complex melange of aromas and taste - sour mash, oak, vinous grapes, dark fruit, puckering green apple and candied fruit.",4.49
Sang Noir,"Dark brown with an amber tinge when held to the light, topped with 4 fingers of orangey beige head.",4.28
Sang Noir,"Deep brown in color with a very murky complexion. There's a fingernail of beige around the rim. I'm smelling tart cherries, either Merlot or Cabernet, and just a suggestion of the sweet bourbon. I'm tasting massively tart cherries, Merlot, and a touch of bourbon. The mouth is very viscous and smooth, which is very unique for a wild ale.",4.38
Sang Noir,Full and barrely and lovely. Lacto tartness hides the booze beautifully. Blended such that neither the vinous nor the bourbon-y taste wins out. Closer to a classic Flanders Red than expected. Oh boy.,4.36
Sang Noir,"This beer pours a dark purple to brown with a small white head. It has medium low carbonation. The beer smells of dark grapes, black cherry, port, bourbon, and cinnamon. It tastes of dark grape skins, black cherry, port, bourbon, and cinnamon. It has a full body, with good complexity. This is s great sour from Cascade.",4.64
Sang Noir,Poured from a 750ml corked bottle into a stemmed wine glass. Purchased in Attleboro MA.,4.25
Sang Noir,"Upon entering the pearly gates and making myself at home, just after I wake up and saunter to the kitchen for breakfast, I imagine this is what Miranda Kerr would be juicing me. A bouquet of super dark fruit and red wine for days are met by a perfect lip puckering punch. Does Raul say hallelujah for Sang Noir? I think he does.",4.41
Sang Noir,"Good God. I'm not even a big sour drinker but every time I put Cascade in my face I'm filled with joy. Had this minutes before A Cantillon Kriek. No contest, this wins.",4.6
Sang Noir,"Pours a cloudy dark brown color with a very thin carbonated head that goes away almost instantly. There is no head retention or lacing. Big sour aroma with wine and a lot of dark fruits. Big sour taste. Wine, raisins, plums. Medium bodied with low to moderate carbonation.",4.36
Sang Noir,"This was a huge beer, it was incredibly thick and heavy on the palate, which is why I knocked a few points off the feel, as it was way too heavy for a sour. That said, it was well executed. You can taste all of the elements involved. The spiced red ale base blends together well with the bourbon and wine barrels. The sour bite comes on strong with the finish.",4.15
Sang Noir,Not a sour guy,4.31
Sang Noir,"On tap at Brewberry Bar in Paris, France. Poured in a 12.5cl tasting glass. Well well, the balance of this beer is amazing the wine notes and bourbon notes mellows quite well and go along the dark berries sourness of the ale with wonder. Amazing beer.",4.68
Sang Noir,"Dark garnet with a creamy, persistent tan-mauve blanket that lifts at the collar, leaving a bumpy ring of lace on the glass.",4.33
Sang Noir,Bottle:,4.13
Sang Noir,Pours murky reddish brown with no head. Hints of gold in the light.,4.49
Sang Noir,Appearance - The beer brings to mind blood red wine.,4.74
Sang Noir,"750ml, caged and corked bottle (2015 Project, @9.9% ABV) - part of a few new Cascade offerings to recently arrive around here. ",4.22
Sang Noir,"Very nice. A LOT happening, but it comes together well. Cherry, oak, red grape, balsamic vinegar, blackberry, lemon, more. The bourbon is incredibly restrained, just a bit in the finish. Quite astringent. Fairly sour. A winner.",4.32
Sang Noir,"It looks like vinegar. It smells like FANCY vinegar - like the stuff from that store that only sells olive oil and vinegars from barrels at the mall. You take a sip - your tongue goes into shock, and your lips turn into a cat's @$$#*@&, But the taste turns, and suddenly it's good... Really good. You go back for another sip to make sure. Then another, and another. Pretty soon you're scouring liquor store shelves for it, but all you can find are their Apricot or Raspberry stuff. The guy at the liquor store tells you, 'it be like that'. I guess 'it do'.",5
Sang Noir,Wow!,5

Vicinity,"Vicinity pours a light, straw yellow with a bit of murk from the flaked wheat. No real head (old can?) or lacing present.

Vicinity,"A: The beer is very cloudy whitish yellow in color, which becomes darker towards the bottom of the can. It poured with a half finger high bright white head that quickly died down, leaving lacing on the surface and a narrow collar around the edge of the glass.",4.28
Vicinity,Canned on Aug/09.,4.59
Vicinity,"Can. From Zombier. In Teku glass. Playing Avernum 5. Really strong frutality and bitterness, with some milkshake ipa reminiscences. Good but didnt live up the hype, as it is nothing that more accessible breweries cant do nor surpass",4.21
Vicinity,This is a great NEIPA. Departs from some of the standards but is still a great beer. I appreciate the level of bitterness as it balances the immense pineapple and papaya that the hops give off.,4.48

Vicinity,Currently #185 in the Top 250 beers list. My first Trillium beer...I'm rather excited.,3.4
Vicinity,"When I first cracked this, it was the first beer from Trillium that I had ever had. I have now come to think that Trillium is second in New England only to Hill Farmstead.",5
Vicinity,Crisp and clean but with some floaters too! Nice tropical fruits up front give way to a solid bit of hoppy bitterness on the end. Refreshing and satisfying double here that doesnt taste like a double.,4.44
Vicinity,"Delicious. Smooth with tons of flavor. Fruity, hazy, with a great finish. Definitely not overdone with the alcohol content like some double IPAs have. To be honest surprised it’s a double IPA almost to smooth to be a double.",4.66
Vicinity,"Pours a golden peach with a fluffy fast dissipating head. Aroma is big on mango and pineapple with a piney crackery malt note. Flavor is tropical fruits, slightly bitter hops, and a soft malt backbone. Goes down smoothly with a crisp finish. A well crafted DIPA.",4.31
Vicinity,Appearance: Arrives cloudy and goldenstraw colored with a frothy but modest head; decent retention and some clumps of lacing hang around,4.35
Vicinity,"Pours Golden yellow, frothy head of foam and thin lace on the glass.",4.33

Vicinity,Canned 2/06/18. Consumed on 2/22/2018.,4.52
Vicinity,"The citrusy, tropical, floral notes in this one makes for one of the best mouth feels in a DIPA that ive had. The balance between the sweetness from the malt bill and the hops combo is great. Galaxy, Citra and Colombus hops makes this extra juicy with a perfect thick haze.",4.53

Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,"A: Thick black pour with elusive mocha-brown highlights, and a head with minimal characteristics: formation, retention, lacing",4.21
Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,"I drove 2 hours each way and stood in line 2 hours to buy this beer. The samples I had on tap while in line were fantastic. However, the beer in the bottles is not the same beer. I get a stale, metallic taste. Jackie O's has struggled with their bottling line the past two years. They still have work to do.",3.83
Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,"375 ml bottle into snifter, 2018 vintage bottling. Pours dense pitch black color with a minimal spotty lace cap. Minimal lacing with some clinging bubbles on the glass. Aromas of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, and dark bread; with lighter notes of coconut, licorice, raisin, prune, fig, date, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, pepper, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Lightly increasing booze in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malts and bourbon barrel notes; with big strength. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, and dark bread; with lighter notes of coconut, licorice, raisin, prune, fig, date, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, pepper, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness.

Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, dark bread, coconut, licorice, dark fruit, light smoke/char/pepper, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts and bourbon barrel flavors; with a solid roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with no cloying, acrid, astringent flavors after the finish. Slightly increasing dryness from lingering roast bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness. Light carbonation and very full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety, and slightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is amazing. Mildly increasing warmth of 13.5%, with no barrel booziness lingering after the finish. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged imperial stout! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV; with the very mildly bitter/tannic/drying finish. Insanely rich malt complexity, with perfect barrel integration/balance. Not overly roasty/charred on malts, or boozy/tannic on barrels. A highly amazing offering, and top tier style example as expected.",4.35

It’s sweet, but it has a really nice dark fruit complexity in the back end. Finish is charred oak. Heavy, pretty sweet. Excellent flavor, but it’s pretty alcoholic.",4.08
Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,"375ml bottle, served in a Side Project stemmed glass. Pours a dark black body, oily, with a bit of hulky leg, one finger offwhite head, short retention, bits of lacing. Smell is chocolate fudge, bourbon, a bit of nuttiness, slight roast, earth, a bit of espresso. Flavour is an unholy mix of bourbon, chocolate fudge, slight vanillin, brownie batter, touch of almond and roast, mildly earthy finish. Mouthfeel is fuller bodied, slightly lower carbonation than would be expected. Overall, an excellent barrel-aged imperial stout that hides its 15% abv extremely well. Holy cow.",4.43

More caramel on the tongue with chocolate as well. Bourbon, oak, and vanilla. Thick and rich on the tongue. A bit creamy with a nice roasty feel. Alcohol is well hidden for 15%. Great beer. Would never believe the abv.",4.76
Jackie O's / Side Project - Appervation,"Appervation tastes a lot like Derivation, with layers of chocolate goodness and roastiness, though it is a little light on the barrel and thin on the mouthfeel. Overall, it feels like a not-so-fully developed Derivation.",4.48

Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of floral coffee notes with some black chocolate note and some subtle bourbon notes. Taste is a mix of floral coffee notes with light residual sugar notes, some chocolate notes with some bourbon notes with light vanilla notes also perceptible. Body is full with good carbonation and no real apparent alcohol notes. Superb coffee based imperial stout with some light and well-balanced bourbon notes.",4.25
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Back as pitch with a thin and light tan head, wonderfully rich coffee on the nose, less bourbon than typical for the brewery but still added to the otherwise simplistic brew. This is in my top two or three for certain though as what it lacks in complexity it more than makes up for in execution and refinement!",4.67
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Coffee bomb... nice, smooth coffee though, not overly bitter. Chocolate notes and some bourbon on the finish. When it finally hits room temp it’s all coffee",4.53

Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,2017 vintage. ,4.58
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"bourbon barrel aged imperial stout with coffee, which on paper sounds like the same thing a million other breweries are doing, but in reality, is unique as can be, more concentrated and intense in all aspects than almost anything else in this field i have had before, which is a large sample size for sure. the coffee here is so fresh, earthy, and rich. its roasted like crazy, with an obvious dark chocolate profile that blends in beautifully with all the dark malts, which in this case stand out more than in a lot of these due to the apparent lack of a sweet malty middle, its all dry and roasty, near black, with the only sweetness at all in here coming from the bourbon, which has honey and vanilla and toasted marshmallow aspects to its sweetness, but its not from grain. it almost tastes like an ice beer, like some of the water was frozen out to make the beer thicker and more pronounced in the flavors, the dark malt here is really deep, and the coffee is dosed heavily enough to match it all the way through. there is a lot of charred oak on this, a faint hint of coconut and raisin right up front, and lots more chocolate. the whiskey is pretty strong here too, but it brings the coffee together with the wood and the heft of the grain. rich vanilla and maple notes in it, and just a little warming alcohol. this is amazingly complex and delicious, a hell of a breakfast beer, and another reason why i am increasingly obsessed with this brewery! this is one of the best of its kind!",4.5
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,Got this in a trade last winter and have been saving it for my birthday. Worth. The. Wait! Wow! Perfect BBA Stout. The bourbon is present but not overwhelming. Wish I had more than just this one!,4.63

Dark roast black, no cream no sugar. Nice sweet bourbon kick that cuts through the coffee. Wood, toasted dark malts, light vanilla and caramel present. A little thin on body, watered down. Still tho a very good stout. If you like your coffee dark. You'll dig this.",4.5
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Poured out jet black, thin tan head on top settling into a ring around the glass. The smell is of molasses, not much coffee but it smells very good regardless.

Nelson,Golden straw. You can really smell the malt bill in this beer which is really supportive of the hops. Hops don't give off a ton of nose but they do taste of pine and grapefruit rind. Mouthfeel is great. The rye really finishes clean.,4.34
Nelson,A: Light hazy gold with rich white foamy head and moderate lacing. ,4.35
Nelson,"Quite enjoyable IPA at Industry! Great citrus aroma, bit of a bite on the tongue, sweet taste, yet delicious and refreshing. Overall a yummy drinkable IPA with Dave!",4.05

Nelson,"Straight pour from a pry-off 12oz bottle to a flared pilsner glass—AZ Wilderness’ Wilderpils glass. This has a bottling date of … who knows. “8254 1 0812,” whatever that means. All I know is that I bought the first sixer I saw in a store, and it’s a very recent release—past couple of weeks. ",4.37
Nelson,"Picked up a few dry cases at, wait for it...Total Wine..Huh? yep, Total had 4 cases on hand and I helped myself to all of them. Tested the 1st bottle slightly chilled, IMO, it's still Nelson, but a little dumbed down in the 12oz bottle. The Nelson that was produced in Alpine before the sale to Green Flash, had so much Nelson hop aroma in the head it would almost trigger a gag reflex, and was unmistakeable for any IPA's that that had Nelson in the recipe. Still overall it's Nelson, and consumed the next 2 bottles chilled and poured into a Riedel 32oz burgundy stem, the look was spot on as in the 1st bottle as was the mouth feel, the smell and taste was evident that they did not use enough Nelson hops. However, at $12.99 a 6pack I think it's tasting better. Lately it's been showing up on tap in LA and the OC, it's always better on tap but get it while you can, however you can. Hopefully New Zeland will cut loose enough Nelson hops for Beachwood BBQ to put Alpha Supreme back on the menu, we can only hope.",4.26

Nelson,Poured into a hybrid glass from a 12oz bottle,4.6
Nelson,It's a light gold color. The appearance is not representative of the overall huge flavor it has. The smell is fresh like orange juice and very piney. The taste is super refreshing and light and very flavorful and the ending notes are exceptionally loaded with fresh hops. It's very high on the drinkability scale. IT's an amazing beer in the IPA category.,4.63
Nelson,"Grunt fill from Albertsons. Bright golden pour, milky, fluffy head fades fast. Fruity, flowery aroma, mild dank notes. More funk and fruit in the taste, drying bitterness. Sweet and bitter.",3.81
Nelson,Pours a very hazy yellow orange with a massive 2 inch head on draft. Leaves loads of lace.,4.29
Nelson,"Amazing beer, my all time favorite. ",4.93
Nelson,"had this on tap. beautiful pour, way hazier than i would have thought - completely opaque. a dense bright white head hangs around for a while and leaves tons of lace. on nose is pine, dankness, grapefruit, citrus peel. this mostly follows on the palate, but there is also a white grape note and a super pithy herbaceous character. some citrus, lemon, grapefruit, orange, showing up as well. good malt presence throughout, and a nice hit of mellow spice from the rye. mouthfeel is on point! this was an absolute pleasure to drink after having so many hazed NE beers - great balance between juicy citrus notes, danky pine and green character, and that touch of spice from the rye. excellent brew!",4.67
Nelson,"4/14/17...pours pale gold, a little hazy, but able to see through. Dry wine nose, very faint. Crisp dark fruity flavor. White wine throughout. Pretty tasty.",3.72
Nelson,"Classic old-school hoppy IPA. Bitter, sure, but the right amount of bitterness - not overwhelming. Quenching when guzzled. A tasty brew. Lucky to get it on tap.",3.75

Nelson,Amber appearance with significant white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is fruit with a touch of citrus and rye. Taste is also a fruit with a touch of citrus and a prominent rye.,4.17
Nelson,On tap at Growler USA in Phoenix. Pours a golden effervescent hue with moderate frothing. Pungent aroma replete with hints of citrus and grapefruit. Piney.,4.24
Nelson,Look: It pours golden with a white head that has moderate head retention. It is fairly clear. ,4.28
Nelson,"Poured from a howler on the day it was tapped. A vigorous pour produces a thick, creamy, light tan, two finger head on top of an orangish tan, slightly opaque beer. The smell knocks you over with fresh citrus and woody/piney hops. There is also a spiciness to it. The taste is bitter hops resin, and a woody, floral spice. The citrus comes through less on the taste than in the nose. The mouthfeel is velvety and smooth. Overall a great beer I'm happy I had the chance to try. It's a unique flavor.",4.25
Nelson,Love love love Nelson hops so I have been trying to get this for a while. Worth the wait. It can stand there with most northeast IPA's. Wish it was more readily available in my area!,4.63
Nelson,One of the first beers I ever had from Alpine. They are probably over all my favorite west coast brewery for hops right now. Super hoppy super smooth too. Nice mix of rye and citrus hops going on with this.,4.57
Nelson,"beautiful nose of lemon, tangerine, and grapefruit. Nice light body, low maltiness, clean and somewhat dry. leaves a lingering bitterness across the tongue in the aftertaste.",4.24

Peche 'n Brett,"Excellent Sour from Oregon. Tons of peaches add nuance, some funk, but not overbearing sourness.

Peche 'n Brett,First time I had this it changed my perspective of fruited American sours. Explosive peach juice and perfect lactic balance. THe 2017 has been overtaken by brett.,3.9
Peche 'n Brett,L -- Pours an ever-so-slightly hazy straw body with practically no head produced with even a well aerated pour. Looks like cider ,4.54
Peche 'n Brett,Very hard to believe this one is 10%. Super drinkable for that ABV. Nose is a rush of lactic sourness and peachy stonefruit. Definitely a tart one but not overly so. I'd grab more of these if it weren't super expensive.,4.44
Peche 'n Brett,"Fresh batch (couldn't read date, but was just distro'ed) ",3.62
Peche 'n Brett,"Tried from the cellar at Niche in Geneva. Had been trying to find a bottle for many years, and the hunt was worth it! First a warning, this beer is dangerous, it tastes so light and peachy, along with signature saison yeast character, that the 10 percent abv is undetectable! So smooth yet has a strong saison presence in the mouthfeel. Bit of an aftertaste of multivitamin with the peach but not in a bad way. Very balanced, would be the perfect beer for a sunny picnic in July.",4.58
Peche 'n Brett,"Hazy gold-amber with a large, airy white foam leaving a layer of chunky lace and settling quickly to a bubbly matt and round collar.",4.12
Peche 'n Brett,Very nice beer. Carb complemented the beer well and it was very refreshing. The star of the show was clearly the peaches. They came through very well and worked excellent with the base beer,4.43
Peche 'n Brett,"Bought for me by a friend, great find in Connecticut! Not overly peachy. Not as carbonated as I was expecting. Gets better with each sip. Would gladly drink anytime!",4.5
Peche 'n Brett,hazy-dark-golden appearance w/ a 1/4 glass of bubbly head. Peach funk scent w/ the slightest sting of acidity. flavor wise..probably the most balanced on the tart/funk spectrum that I've ever had w/ a full dose of peach to boot. This bitch squats a mouthfeel-full rack to parallel. Heavily enjoying this sipper on a mildly pleasant early fall New England Friday afternoon.,4.46

Peche 'n Brett,"I enjoyed this brew, just not quite as much as I expected. The brett is well done and not overpowering, but I found myself wanting more fresh peach out of it. It's there on the nose, but not enough for me in the taste. I had it on tap in Eugene, so I'm not sure when it was brewed, but I assume fairly recently. I doubt the peach has mellowed with age, I just think that's what Logsdon was going for. The alcohol is certainly well hidden. Perhaps I'll give it another shot and revised as warranted. For me, good but not great.",3.86

Peche 'n Brett,"Pours orange, hazy and cloudy. Smells of peach, sugar, floral, dirt. Flavor is abundant of both peach and brett (surprise, surprise) somewhat sharp, but not boozey. ABV is well hidden. I almost wish I aged this longer to get it a bit smoother, but I wanted to taste the peach before it faded. Overall, enjoyable.. but there may be better options for the hefty price tag.",3.84

Todd The Axe Man,CANNED ON 10/11/19,4.2
Todd The Axe Man,"Skunky bitter West Coast IPA. There is absolutely nothing interesting about this beer. Normally, I would blame poor taste on the age of the beer, but based on the date on the can, it's barely one month old.",2.76
Todd The Axe Man,"The beer looked like a prototypical IPA when poured. The body was pale amber in color, slightly hazy, and formed a one finger thick head. The aroma was very citric, evoking a delicious grapefruit. Deeper inhalation invoked some other fruits like guava and mango. The taste was bright and quit citric, reminding of grapefruit once again. The mouthfeel was medium and the alcohol non evident. Excellent.",4.36

Todd The Axe Man,"Canned on 8/19/19. 16oz can poured into a tulip. Pours a hazy golden, but it's not cloudy or murky; small white head that fades leaving decent retention and lacing. The aromas are floral along with some citrus notes. Mild hints of coconut in the mix. Some fresh grass. Some bread and crackers. Malts are there. The flavors basically follow the nose. Some grapefruit and orange coming through. More subtle hints of coconut. More fresh grass. More bread and crackers. Solid bitterness. Mild spiciness. Some black pepper coming through in the finish. Malts do their thing without dominating. Finishes juicy and dry at the same time, but it's probably on the juicier side. Alcohol goes unnoticed for the most part. Mouthfeel is nice. It's on the fuller side of medium-bodied with active carbonation. It's sharp, crisp, slightly fluffy, smooth and easy to drink. ",3.57

Todd The Axe Man,"16oz. can served in a willibecker. Pours a dull, burnt orange with a half inch, fluffy, off-white head. Nose is all old school hops - citrus, herbal, dank and some notes of caramel malt. Taste consistent with nose with a medicinal bitterness at the finish.

Todd The Axe Man,"Had from can dated 8/6/19 in Seattle. Was really looking forward to this but was a bit disappointed with it. Had a bit of a ""new brewery"" taste to it. Never know how to describe it but malt and musty. It does tend to happen with midwestern beers I've had before. Very drinkable and otherwise pleasant but just not as good as the 99 rating to me.",3.71
Todd The Axe Man,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy, medium golden amber with a one finger white head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, orange, lemon, grapefruit, light mixed tropical fruit. Flavor is caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, grapefruit, yuzu, orange, lemon, mild guava and pine needles. Medium bodied with light creaminess. Glad to finally try something from this legendary IPA brewery and it is quite nice. Aroma and initial taste are classic Mid to West Coast style, with an emphasis on citrus and pine. The hop herbal flavors reveal themselves over the taste, which is what I hope for in a big IPA. Great alpha oil finish with resinous pine and citrus rind. The malt thins out a little in the finish, but there is still a fine, lingering hop bitterness. I hope this stays in our market; with all the local breweries emphasizing hazies and bruts, I will take my classic IPA fix from any source and this is a promising one.",4.21

Color is black, which pours with a three finger mocha head that burns fast to a ring with lots of lacing. First sips follow the nose, but with stronger bourbon, more toasty coconut,and barrel. Balanced impeccably. Slightly sweet with a full, creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol hides well, but has a slight warming later. Excellent base stout flavors. Not sure it will warm up, considering it’s about 30 degrees on the deck. Buy it when you see it.",4.62

I can't believe I forgot to review this one and glad I had one more bottle (wish I had a case). Definitely an omg beer on the first taste, rich, well balanced, slightly sweet, but not cloying, a silky, creamy mouth feel to die for. This is a world class strong ale that would be hard to improve.

Sante Adairius / Triple Rock Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"good heavens this is good. thanks to drlovemd87. he purged his cellar this week and i was the fortunate dumping ground. he may have mixed up, because this is insanely special beer, and i am very lucky to have tried it. cracked the bottle knowing nothing about it, but was quickly impressed with its every detail. neat frosted yellow color to it, good white head, creamy and rich, but soft and delicate too, dreamy and sexy, cool. smells awesome, slight tartness to it, but some of that is the hop tropicality going on, funky brett, very mature and dry, with a bit of pucker to it, maybe a hint of some souring cultures, but a lot more brett than bacteria from what i can gather. lots of hops too, juicy and tropical, southern hemisphere and heavy handed. i get some wheat in the malt base, belgian pils, maybe some oats too, it has that fluffy texture to it. the oak is impressive here, maybe a slight suggestion of white wine, but here i get vanilla and sweetness from wet fresh oak, not a barrel of any kind. tons of must and musk and funk from the brett, an old school belgian type i would guess, reminds me of some cool old world saisons in that way. lemony as can be, but also pineapple, lime, and passion fruit come into the fold with the hops. what i want to savor and remember about this thing though is the yeast, i want it forever on my palate, i want to copy it in my homebrew, and i want every brewery who attempts to make beer in this style to try it, because this is what its supposed to taste like. unsure ive had one ive liked this much. great carbonation, crackling dry, and with a very special mystique about it in general. i want to bathe in this stuff. my goodness.",4.53

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"First 3 of the 4 pack were fresh and this last one is just short of a year in the cellar. Pours about as dark as it gets and just as you think there will be no head at all, a centimeter of thick foam slowly appears out of the abyss. Nose is vanilla, brown bread, leather, and what to me smells like brown sugar pop tarts. Taste is...damn that's fucking good. Pretty much what you'd expect from the nose but the thickness of this beer is pretty amazing considering the ABV and barrel aging. Some tobacco, and some residual sweetness really round this out. Overall, damn.",4.59

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"It looks motor oil thick and used motor oil black and shiny in the glass. Minimal dark tan head rests on top and quickly diffuses into spotty islands of lace and a thin ring around. The aroma is huge vanilla, oak, bourbon, and dark bakers chocolate. Taste is Ah-mayze-ing! Super rich dark chocolate is the first thing that hits me, followed by some tobacco, vanilla, oak, a little coffee, and some slight bourbon heat on the finish. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected, but still on the full side of medium. Oily, slick, coating my mouth at all angles with a dry finish but NOT chalky. Overall this is fantastic and every bit worthy of its high marks.",4.85
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Had this for the second time with a little more age, and while it is not a Black Note, or a Fremont, BCBS, or KDS it is really close to the latter with different characteristics - this is truly a stout to be reckoned with in a field of wannabes!",4.31

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Bottled 10/16/2018. Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. It pours a very dark walnut - nearly black - with a half finger of creamy, light mocha-colored head and thin sheen of lacing. On the fragrant nose there is a heavy scent of bourbon along with roasted malt, dark chocolate, freshly-brewed coffee, toffee, hazelnut, and black cherry. This is absolutely delicious! It opens with rich chocolate and coffee followed by caramel/toffee, tobacco, char, and the always welcome notes of black cherry and plum. The bourbon is strong but not overpowering. It compliments the other flavors rather than distracting. The mouth feel is rich and creamy with low/moderate carbonation, and the 13.4% ABV is delightfully warming. While I'm a big fan of the standard version of Expedition, this is an entirely different drinking experience. It stands toe to toe with KBS.",4.53
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,Pours a very dark brown — near black — with a finger of mocha-colored head that lasts a decent amount of time for such a large beer. Sheets of lacing.,4.25
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"I don’t think the bourbon really imparts much flavor to this one and it never finds that harmony between the base beer & the barrel. Lots of charred oak, tobacco leaf, black anise, etc...misses some of those smoother counterpoints (vanilla, caramel, etc) bourbon can bring to balance it out",3.67
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Drinking it straight from the fridge (meaning too cold) and I notice the smell is bourbon and chocolate. It pours thick and syrupy. Lacing sticks around after the pour. As it warms, the chocolate bitterness builds and strengthens. There's a lot going on flavor wise. There's some sweetness but less than a BCS. It drinks very very smooth and although I taste the alcohol a bit, it's not overbearing at all. I'm glad I finally scored some this year and will try to get it always.",4.54
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,Absolutely a world class beer all the way around... jeez... this is really really good... big barrel influence in absolutely the best way... it's what I look for in a barrel aged offering... it's there...and big... but it's not the star...the base beer still is... complete wheelhouse for me...like fudgy bourbon balls that you get at Christmas.... do not pass this one up if you spot it... worth every penny...,4.75

Smell picks up on the robust elements first: leather, wood, coffee, smoke, molasses, then mixed in with the sweeter dark chocolate, bourbon, licorice, ginger, and then a finishing wash of wood tannins, smoke and roasted malt. Taste is more focused on the wood, bourbon and licorice immediately, then the rest of the flavors from the aroma plus a hint of vanilla, great wood throughout. Fantastic heavy stout",4.64

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Arguably the Hefeweizen that sets the standard for all others. The clove, banana, bubble gum, and lemon are all in perfect balance in the aroma as well as sip to sip. Mouthfeel is a very solid medium bodied and maybe just a tad full for the style. This is a phenomenal Weiss beer, but just be careful to avoid stale bottles and kegs on this side of the Atlantic.",4.28
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.,4.73
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"The beer poured a nice, pleasant color. The smell was a little intriguing at first, though I had never tried this type of beer before. Smelled of sharp yeast and light fruit notes, name banana. Taste was incredible — sharp yeast notes without being too sour, and a very overwhelming taste of banana. Mouthfeel was very full-bodies. Overall, excellent beer.",4.8
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"If you crave a wheat beer and if it's available with other wheat choices it's definitely a pick to get or to order. Banana, clove, it's all there. But it's a tad too heavy in texture and heavy in the aftertaste. Not in a sense of beiing unpleasant or anything like that, but on a sense of lacking certain quality of freshness of a wheat grain. I guess that's why it's available year round, and the old wheat definitely adds to an old starchy ending.",4.45
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"It seems a classic beer not in the ratings but also in the taste.. Perhaps it is the most balance ""Hefe-Weissbier"" beer i have try but not the best for me.. ",3.9

The malts are toasty and sweet, the yeast is sharp but not sour, and the wheaty balance is exceptional. Don't waste time drinking trendy American hefes, always go German first.",4.24
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Bottle pour to tall glass. Huge, dense, white head with good retention, hazy yellow color, minimal lacing. Nose of banana, yeasty. Taste is bright, wheat, bread, banana, clove. Finish is crisp. Body and carbonation are above average.",4.45

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"It being in the low 90's at the PONDerosa, today and just back from a stint at the pool, The PubScout decided to take a break from his usual IPA summer slakers and go back in time--like 1200+ years. Weihanstephaner Staatsbrauerei had hops growing near its monastery in 768 AD.

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"This was possibly the best beer I have ever had. I had two full Maßkrugs of this beer at the German American Cultural Society of Rhode Island's Sommerfest event. It was on tap, and was just perfect. It had a cloudy amber look to it and a clean, fresh, refreshing flavor. I HIGHLY recommend this beer.",4.87
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Ooo. Expanding my horizons here. I’ve tried a good few hefe’s Of the American variety so was happy to find this highly rated Bavarian style, from the world’s oldest brewery no less (they must be doing something right by now!). Look and smell were enjoyable but the taste is heavy - almost oily, this lends itself to a nice full mouthfeel, but I prefer brighter/cleaner/crisper to date.",3.84
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,My review from the beer on the grounds IN FREISING. Maybe at some point when the IPA fad dies down the Germans will start shipping in CANS and shipping with expeditiousness. This is the definition of summer beer. No orange required.,5

A truly exceptional example of a perfectly brewed beer, not just for its style, IN GENERAL. This is one to keep in your fridge always.",4.99
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"An absolutey superb beer, and one of my favourites. I lived in Berlin for 3 years and this was considered an expensive beer at the beer shop, about euro1.50/500ml.

Darkstar November,"Had on tap. Dark, brooding and smooth. Pour jet black and viscous with slight brown foam that quickly dissipates. Has a bitter bite to awaken the drinker from the smooth and tranquil body.

Darkstar November,Appearance: poured jet black with a highly viscous looking consistency. The head was bright brown that vanished quickly. No lacings around glass. ,4.39
Blanc De Blancs,"Acts exactly like champagne. Foams up immediately, recedes quickly, bubbles rising from nucleation sites on the bottom of the glass. Crazy musty aromas, with a Moscato-like sweetness. Between the musty funk and sweet white wine aromas, the jaw-aching tartness from the first sip is a bit of a shock. The 10% is front and center with tons of white wine, funk, barrel, and a dry as a bone finish.",4.05
Blanc De Blancs,Burnt amber with a fizzy head that dies instantly to an almost still surface but for a light effervescence coming up in the center.,3.97
Blanc De Blancs,"Copper colored, hazy, and with no real head. The aroma is of very forward oak and chardonnel grapes. I'm tasting the chardonnel grapes, oak, and very tart microflora. There's nothing subtle about the aggressiveness of the flavors here. The mouth is bone dry, lightly acidic, and offers moderate carbonation.",4.26
Blanc De Blancs,"Aroma is complex and very, very intense in aroma. Super funky aroma with breadiness, grape must etc. It's quite spectacular. Taste comes off moderate to high sour scale, high acidity, and a little bit boozy. Sweet as well blended with the sour. Not quite as funky in the taste as in the aroma. Feel is quite interesting as the sweet/sour taste you'd expect a cloying syrupiness in the back of your throat but it finishes very clean. Gets high marks for that.",4.71
Blanc De Blancs,"Thanks to Harrison8 for this one. Blend 2. 12oz bottle poured into 12oz tulip. Poured a cloudy straw yellow color with a head of tight, white bubbles that were dissipating quickly as the beer poured. In fact, there was no head left even as I finished the pour. Obviously, there was no lacing. But, the sound of the effervescence from the carbonation was amazing. i could hear the beer from arms length.",4.15

Blanc De Blancs,"A soured biere de champgne, well this is a first! Love both style, and this hybrid is a winner too. Nic champagne yeast and malt base with succulent sour grape, bright flowers, and dry white wine and oak finish. Goes from dry, to wet, to back to dry, with each switch unlocking new flavors. Smell has more of a musk and yeast center, but very spring like and pleasant. Touch of cumulative acidity and sneaky carbonation.",4.44

Blanc De Blancs,"Pours a rich golden color with a bright effervescent head that recedes quickly. Smell is lemon, citrus, stone fruit, funk, yogurt. Taste is essentially like a light white sparkling wine with tart yogurt intermixed. Lots of white grape, peach, apple, pear with a creamy yogurty sourness. Really tastes like a fruit on the bottom yogurt cup. The mouthful is rich and creamy while the carbonation keeps it light. Outstanding beer. My biggest issue with Fuzzy is that the subtle sweetness of the white peaches were drowned out by the intense yogurty sourness. Blueberry Flanders had a nice balanced refreshing tartness but the blueberry flavor was a bit disappointing. This is a much better balance for my taste than both, a best of both worlds. Probably my favorite SP so far. Get it today!",4.86
Blanc De Blancs,"A wonderful aroma on this one of big lemony tart qualities, almost a plastic funk. ",4.26
Blanc De Blancs,"A- Pours a bright, medium straw golden in color. A small, one finger head forms and dissipates quickly down to a trace of bubbles around the edges of the glass. The body of the beer is nearly entirely clear. The lacing is minimal with the lack of a prominent head.",4.55
Blanc De Blancs,"The beer pours a dull sunset like golden yellow with no head, visible carbonation, and (with some careful pouring) no sediment. The nose has a slightly floral/vanilla grain & barrel sweetness, surprisingly limited tartness, underlying grape notes, and minimal funk/acetone. It has a mild, champagne-like grape taste upfront with grain rounding out profile and lingering alcohol and oak. The beer has a light-medium body, but is not as crushable as expected (mainly due to the alcohol content) and a slightly chewy sweetness. Carbonation is relatively low and acidity is lower than expected - the beer still finishes with that punishing dry oak slap in the palate. The beer's so limited and expensive that I'd probably avoid purchasing it again in the future (or at least my full allotment), but it's undeniably delicious.",4.4

Mastermind,A: Pours a hazy yellow color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a thin cap that leaves good lacing,4.44
Mastermind,Appearance - Pours bright opaque yellow with a thin white head settles to a rocky ring. No lacing.,4.31
Mastermind,"Canned 6/6/19, drank 7/5/19. Can has notation, “HarrisMillis”. Is this pineapple juice or a beer? Sweet, drinkable, super cloudy, pineapple juice colored and opaque like pineapple juice also. Would be nicer with more head. My first from fiddlehead and it won’t be my last!Thanks Warnerry!",4.55
Mastermind,"Traded for this beer a while ago, as it had the date of 6/24/16 on the bottom of the can with ""C U @ SPAC"" written underneath that. Unlike many of the beers that I've had in my cellar that I'm finally getting around to, this didn't hold up that well and I'm sure it would be a zillion times better fresh. I still vowed to review everything that I'm going through and this certainly won't be an exception to that rule!",3.2

Mastermind,Serving: Can,4.08
Mastermind,Canned on 2/21/19,4.25
Mastermind,12 oz. Can version. ,4.51
Mastermind,Hazy really pale yellow color with white head. Aroma has dank and earthy hop notes with some slightly spicy malt notes. Taste is grassy and herbal with a medium bitterness and a bit of alcohol on the finish. Medium body with medium minus carbonation. Quite good but not really up to the hype.,4
Mastermind,"A: Yellow, cloudy, white head, not murky yeast slurry!",4.49
Mastermind,Poured from a 12 oz can into an Alesmith tulip,4.41
Mastermind,Look: Yellow hazy with medium white head. Has low carbonation.,4.72
Mastermind,Pours a hazy gold with a very fluffy three finger head. That head lasts for quite a while before breaking. Excellent lacing. ,4.27
Mastermind,"Nothing too intense going on here (regular brownish mostly yellow pour, regular bitterness, regular booze flavor), but perhaps a little light on the flavor overall.",3.23
Mastermind,"Can dated 10/16/17 into pint glass. Pours a hazy yellowish-amber with an off-white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Initial impression is juicy citrus, caramel, tropical fruit, pineapple, and a slight pine-y hops bitterness. Very smooth, nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is quite hefty; carbonation is on the light side. Finish is sweet fading to a slight bitterness on the back of the tongue. Very, very well done.",4.28
Mastermind,"Smooth, fruity with a great subtle bite throughout the front and back end flavor. Tried the flagship IPA and their oat/wheat IPA as well in the taproom this weekend, and this one blows them both away by a mile. Love this.",4.44
Mastermind,Cloudy straw color with moderate white head that desipates quickly. Aroma is hoppy with a hint of citrus. Taste is a nice balance of hoppy and citrus that is very smooth.,4.52
Mastermind,"This was poured into a snifter. The appearance was a hazy burnt grapefruit yellow to orange color. The head dissipated immediately leaving some messy sticky lacing clinging to the glass. The smell started off with juicy grapefruit leaning towards the pulp side. Bitterness comes from the pine and has a slight underscore of citrus rind to balance. The taste reels in the sweet grapefruit and brings about a nice settling clean bitter sticky pine. The aftertaste is quick, sharp and light grapefruit with a crisp finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a clean crisp sticky grapefruit and slightly resinous feel coating my tongue. Overall, this was an extremely well done DIPA that I would love to have again.",4.52
Mastermind,"Poured a beautifully bright and only slightly cloudy yellow with a full head of nice white foam. Aromas and flavors are bursting with pineapple qualities: it truly tastes like biting into a fresh, sweet tropical pineapple while on the beach of an island paradise. For a beer that doesn't have any added fruits or juices, this is the most pineapple flavor I've ever encountered in a brew; it's not cloying or too sweet though. There's some bitterness on the back end of the creamy and lightly effervescent mouthfeel. Just wonderful.",4.75
Mastermind,Beautiful cloudy yellow-orange body. Thin white head. ,4.68
Mastermind,Can into a snifter appears a hazy pale golden yellow color with a white cap that fades leaving spotty lace.,3.84
Mastermind,Beautifully done. Very bright and smooth hop forward IPA by Fiddlehead. Had a great amount of tropical fruits and smooth taste. Nice golden yellow look as well.,4.43
Mastermind,White head. Hazy straw yellow. Lots of lace left.,4.5
Double Orange Starfish,"Very good, hazy,I would not recommend drinking from the can as they leave a small yeast cake in the bottom. Pour into a glass slowly an don,t pour the last half inch into the glass or the yeast goes in and destroys the beer, and result is nasty-ruining the beer. Also very pricey. There are other better choices for that kind of money",4.24
Double Orange Starfish,One to be remembered. Citrus. thick-bodied with that NE-style haze appearance we have all started to know and love. This beer is one of the better IPA's I've had in a while,4.79
Double Orange Starfish,L - Hazy golden/orange with a creamy white head that somewhat sticks around but leaves behind a ton of lacing. ,4.5
Double Orange Starfish,"Traded for this a while ago, but the date on the bottom of the can was not completely legible so I have no idea how old this was when I cracked it open on this hot night! Saw the lofty rating for this and even though this can wasn't fresh, this was as big and enjoyable a juice bomb that I've had in quite some time, and easily one of the best New England IPA's that I've ever been able to review here at the house!",4.43
Double Orange Starfish,"Personally, I was disappointed with the regular Orange Starfish, but figured this beer was worth a try based on the accolades. Yup. It's good. Nice sweet fruit on the nose and tongue, and a very creamy mouthfeel. Well balanced as well. Seems more like 6.7% than 8.3%. Little bit of papaya and powdered sugar. Not as good as a few of their beers (Grovestand), but better than most (Dunley Place). I wish this really was their ""standard"" beer and they worked variations from here instead of putting out a lot of hit or miss beers.",4.33
Double Orange Starfish,"Purchased at Aslin Beer Company, Herndon, VA, second or third batch I've tried.",4.71
Double Orange Starfish,"Drank from a 1 pint (473ml) can purchased at Aslin Beer Company, Herndon, VA",4.58
Double Orange Starfish,Pours a blurry pale orange with a massive soft white head that seems content to stick around for the long haul. Sticky icky lacing as well.,3.98
Double Orange Starfish,L - 2.5 finger stubborn offwhite head atop a dirty orange body.,4.22
Double Orange Starfish,"Pours an opaque ripe-orange with a hint of light turning the edges an opaque white. Head is a finger in height (half pour from can) with good retention. Aroma is orange, grapefruit, resiny hops and biscuity, yeasty malts. Orange is jam like, but smooth and a little less residual sugar. Aroma has a little green bite to it at the finish along with a little alcohol when swirled. Flavor profile is orange, papaya, tangerine and raw grain, peanut and biscuity malts and yeast at the finish. Hop notes are solid, but not in the face, setting up a very controlled presence. Alcohol is absent from the flavor profile. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a smooth - almost still - consistency that opens up to a lightly silty grain at the finish. In other words, texture is akin to a lightly rindy orange juice. Overall, hops are solid and mingle well with the malts, although the hops steal the show. It's getting a little higher in ABV, but the alcohol still remains absent in the flavor profile despite making a brief appearance in the aroma.",4.23
Double Orange Starfish,"Looks like a cloudy orange juice with a half inch head that tons of dots of lacing. Smells predominately of oranges with some malt and a bit of earthiness. Tastes of orange, mango, melon, a hint of vanilla, malt and some earthiness. Medium to full bodied, medium carbonation, a very nice hop bite with mild to moderate bitterness, creamy yet somewhat sticky mouth feel.",4.49
Double Orange Starfish,"Super opaque pale yellow body, identical to Tropicana oj with a massive slightly white head that leaves a full curtain of lacing. Nose is a big punch of pulpy not very sweet oj with a trailing edge of earthiness. Taste follows suit but is a bit more sweet than I expected, but in a good way because the balance of bitter orange, sweetness and a dry, gritty edge. Body is big, thick and dry. Very well done.",4.46
Double Orange Starfish,"I was underwhelmed with the regular Orange Starfish, but the double is outstanding. Tropical nose, big melon and citrus flavor, body is nice and full. ",4.58
Double Orange Starfish,"Pours a golden hazy hue. Lots of citrusy aroma. Wow, this really delivers. A lot of galaxy beers have been over hopped and provide a hop burn that is unbecoming, but this greatly balances the hops. There's a beautiful minerality. It is citrus fruit heaven. I really enjoyed this.",4.43
Double Orange Starfish,"i was so stoked to try this after hearing and reading an awful lot about it, and maybe it didnt travel well to colorado, but i was somewhat unimpressed by this when i had it at hops and pie this week, its a tasty beer, a cool expression of the hops, sturdy and fresh and goof, but it really didnt stand out to me as overly high quality or anything. its rusty orange tinted without a ton of head and a hazy density to it, mucky even. the aroma might be the best part, cut tangerine and orange zest, heavier citra than we usually get, subtle apricot and peach, layered and interesting for a couple of hops i know pretty well. the flavor is good too, starting better than it ends though, fruity and bright up front, plenty of orange character, orange candy, lemongrass, and a little grain sweetness, this is a little bigger than it needs to be right away for me, like i would love to try the original instead of the double, it seems just a little forced. right past the delicious apex of this, it turns green and chemical, over hopped, bitey, less refined than the best of these are by a long shot, and i have no idea if its an age thing, a flaw, or something from transit, but it really makes this pretty hard to drink and seems a shame after such an enjoyable experience up until here. past the saturation point and then a bit bitter as a result, broken down and muddled compared to earlier on, and by the end of a glass, i dont want any more at all, and i am left thinking this isnt any better than anything we have locally here in the same style, and when i think about the ones i have loved from the likes of outer range, trve, and cerebral, i realize this isnt really worth the attention it seems to have gotten. cool that it came through here, but ill need to try it closer to the source i think to get a better feel for it...",4.15
Double Orange Starfish,"L: Poured from a growler to a snifter glass. Had a dark orange color and a super-cloudy consistency. There was a 3/4"", foamy, very long-lasting head. Excellent lacing.",4.29
Double Orange Starfish,"Awesomely good NEIPA. Looks perfect. Big juicy tropical and citrus notes, My only beef is it has a bit of a bite to it. Other than that it's an outstanding brew.",4.83
Double Orange Starfish,"I've had Double and Triple. Same great taste as Triple Starfish without being such a heavy hitter. This unfiltered beer has a great mouthfeel, perfect level of bitterness.",4.7
Double Orange Starfish,"loads of candied orange, peach rings, rich doughy honey malt notes, cream, mango, grapefruit, and a touch of herbaceousness that provides a mellow green quality. soft mouthfeel and overall very tasty!",4.52
Double Orange Starfish,Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass.,4.35
Double Orange Starfish,No canned date,4.4
Double Orange Starfish,"Drank this out of the can at a Nationals tailgate put on like Aslin. This just reminded me of heady topper for whatever reason - maybe a little sweeter up front, but a very similar nice bitterness. Would love to have this on the regular somehow!",4.68
Double Orange Starfish,"Serious orange bomb with soft mouth feel and a hoppy bitter finish. A lot better closer to room temperature than fridge temperature. A touch of ABV heat right at the finish of the hop bitterness that compromises the beer a bit, but that is being really picky.",4.48
Double Orange Starfish,"Appearance: Pours like an orange smoothie, with the bubble show eventually separating the liquid from the head; two fingers of foam stick above the cloudy orange liquid; excellent stickage that leaves a few shards",4.49
Double Orange Starfish,"This one pours a very hazy and murky bright orange, with a small head, and lots of lacing.",4.19
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Yeasty, fairly dry, and a reasonable barrel presence - wine notes are subtle, but grapes can definitely be distinguished. The nose is just a bit floral and quite pleasant.",4.34

Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"B2 April 4, 2017",5
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"2/28/2018 bottle shared with 5 others. Poured into a tulip glass. Poured a clear golden color with a bubbly, effervescent white head that lingered. Aromas of funk, oak, hay and subtle acidity fill my nose. Not much of a farmhouse aroma here as I feel like the barrel aging did away with that. Taste is divine. Tart, oaky, subtle acidity in the finish. Muted layers of farmhouse here but not very prevalent. Feel is light and bubbly. Almost champagne like. Damn good. Overall, this is an outstanding brew. HF already makes world class non BA saisons and when you toss them into a barrel, they elevate to a whole new level.",4.66
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"I have had Dorothy before and think it’s wonderful. This bbl aged, dry hopped version is spectacular and I am so glad I shared it with a friend who appreciated it as much as I did. Smooth and tasty. To be sipped and savored. My taste buds are overwhelmed. Yay HF",4.71

Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),L: Golden honeycomb hues with a thin white head,4.75
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Gold pour, hazy, larger head. White wine, grape, oak, yeast, slightly catty, citrus aroma. Nelson and citra hops give way to yeast, oak, white wine, white grape. Slight catty taste. Lighter body, drying mouthfeel. Stellar",4.6
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"This one pours a mostly clear golden sunshine yellow, with a small head, and a very small amount of lacing.",4.57
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Had onsite at Anniversary 2017, and it was amazing. So different than regular Dorothy, wouldn't recognize the association. Barrel Dorothy was golden and slightly opaque, fluffy lasting head, fruity, mild barrel tones, and smooth. Unbelievable, must try!",4.88
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"This is a glorious example of why Hill Farmstead is probably the best brewery in the world. Complex layer upon layer of flavors, smells and mouthfeel that was simply amazing. I aged this for a year in my cellar and just spectacular....even better than when I had it last year.",4.96
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Awesome beer, very reminiscent of HF Sue--one of my all time favorites.... Nice Funky Saison with citrus and grapefruit bitterness on the finish, with a kick of dry hops, very concentrated and delicious!",4.58
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),Bottle shared by ygtbsm94. Thanks Brad!,4.66
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Review is based on the dregs (last in line for a pour). Pours a cloudy orange hue akin to Sunny Delight. Nose expresses citrus, rind a just a hint of the wine barrel. Taste follows nose - a little little yeasty, but to be expected considering the pour was off the bottom of the bottle. Mouthfeel is light in body with a mild, even carbonation. All and all, quite enjoyable; however, I'd like to revisit with a proper pour.",3.97
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Big upgrade over original Dorothy in my opinion. The wine barrel add so much complexity, and this was perfectly carbonated as well. Not a lot of bells and whistles with adjuncts and or fruit being added, just a beautiful barrel-aged Saison.",4.73
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"This has a wonderful bursting lemon mixed with pith that makes this complex, sophisticated and easy drinking. A major upgrade from regular Dorothy. Great offering, almost in the realm of Art, Ann and Le Sarrasin.",4.62
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Pours golden. There's a musty grape aroma, some tropical hops as well. The aroma is incredible and it carries through into the flavor and feel. There's good wine barrel presence, but it's balanced by the Hill mixed culture and the dry hop. There is funkified tropical fruit and some grassiness on the finish. It's amazingly complex, super balanced, with no component overpowering the rest. BA Dorothy is a phenomenally delicate beer.",4.67
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"750ml bottle, served in a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass. Pours a hazy golden yellow body, one finger thick head, short retention, bits of lacing. Typical HF saison appearance. Smells of grapefruit and citrus, more of a hop aroma, light bitterness and a bit of white wine sweetness and must. Light funk. Bits of oak. Flavour brings out more dry white wine grape, nice mustiness, light farmhouse funk, oak, and light acidity with a more grapefruit zesty bitterness. Very solid. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, good carbonation, light and bitter citrus and saison yeast on the finish. Smells like a Hill Farmstead IPA, but with more of a white wine twist and complexity to it. It's not necessarily one of the better saisons from this brewery, but for what it is, it is very nice.",4.33

Enjoy By IPA,"(For the 10.31.19 version): this one is the best of the series since last year's July 4th version. Pours a gorgeous golden color with a decent head. Nice lacing. The aroma is pure heaven: some maltiness and resin up front, and tropical fruit noticeable. Taste is incredible: a veritable hop explosion, with peaches and those same tropical notes more pronounced. This is a dank brew with a pleasing aftertaste as well. Get it and enjoy, while it lasts.",4.62
Enjoy By IPA,"07.04.19, clearly not a fair review over two months out so I'll be understanding. Gold with fluffy three finger head. Whispy clouds of particulate. Sweet malt base with soft grassy, citrus, and floral hops. Some booze. The flavor is sweet, concentrated malt with grass, citrus and lots of booze. The hop character, I think, has faded, but it's still an enjoyable enough beer. While it starts out fairly sweet, the finish is dry with medium, pithy bitterness.",3.74

Enjoy By IPA,"Pours clear, like well shined brass, with a small-to-medium head that leaves plenty of lace. Nose is not big at all for what I thought this beer would be. Certainly some malt syrup and a little dank citrus, but certainly could have been bigger. Taste is more like what I expected with both the heavy hops and malt coming through. Earthy, bitter citrus, and heavy graham cracker. Very good beer, but I expected more.",4.19

Enjoy By IPA,It’s was a Christmas miracle for me today when I found this at my Piggly Wiggly. I’ve know about this beer for years but I could never find it in my area. What a Great Beer! Pours a crystal clear amber with great lacing. Smells of fresh pine and citrusy bliss. So smooth at first with a big hoppy bite you want in an IPA. Mouthfeel is outstanding with very light carbonation. 9.4%ABV is sneaky because this beer is so smooth and refreshing. Merry Christmas to all and to all a Great DIPA.,4.79

Enjoy By IPA,"Damn if that isn’t one of the freshest IPAs I’ve had in a long time. I thought the “enjoy by” thing on the front of the can might have been a gimmick, and surely this beer couldn’t be as good as the reviews say? But it was everything I could have hoped for, and more. Nice bright light copper-amber color with some foamy head and just a trace of spotty lingering lacing. Smells great, nice big bold citrus zest aromas with a little pine in the background. Tastes amazing. Loads of fresh citrus fruit - passionfruit, orange, tangerine, mango, grapefruit, lemon - as well as piney hops, floral hops, vanilla, bread and a great well-balanced malt backbone. So smooth, easy to drink and great mild mouthfeel. Just the right amount of carbonation. It’s additionally an imperial IPA but you’d never guess it since the higher ABV is well-hidden and the bitterness is just right, not too bracing, not too subtle. An outstanding beer and I will venture back to a local pub to sample this one on tap.",4.36
Enjoy By IPA,"[Original rating 2015-12-30] Draft at Horseshoe Pub, Hudson, MA. Aroma of citrus, a little pine. Taste is fresh citrusy hops, perfectly balanced with malt. Excellent IIPA.",4.52

Enjoy By IPA,"This beer's color absolutely radiates gold with a big foamy head, an absolutely gorgeous pour. Aroma is upbeat and citrusy, but nothing truly of note. Taste is smooth, dank but sweet with the expected hops bite. The big ABV and malt keep it mostly sweet at the back end of a swallow. Mouthfeel, again, is incredibly smooth. Delicious, but maybe a little too rich for more than one or two a sitting.",4.19

Scaled Up,"By far one of my favorite hazy IPA's from Trill. I feel like i say that every time i try a new one. This one is a beautiful yellow amberish hue with tons of haze. It has an amazing aroma coming from the dry hopping and hops combo which they killed. Citrusy, dank, notes of mango, grapefruit, subtle sweetness but also malty enough to balance great with the hops creating an almost perfect mouthfeel. Love you Trillium!",4.71

Scaled Up,"I was lucky enough to have gotten an entire four pack from my friend John's trip up to the NE. It looks cloudy and yellow, and smells of floral hops. The flavor is more balanced than other trilliums I've had. It's fruity, bitter, almost sweet, and has a medium lasting bitterness on the end. Nit-picking, it's not my favorite trillium, but still far better than most other brews.",4.28

Scaled Up,"Pale golden, thin head, and very small lacing. Aromas of intense grapefruit and dank resin. Notes of grapefruit pulp, citrus peel, stonefruit and pine. Medium, feels thinner than you'd expect, dry and crushable. It's good but it's lacking depth and it's an ugly beer.",4.07
Scaled Up,"This is one of the better beers ive had. I had the privilege of enjoying this from a large can ""crowler"". Amazing flavor taste and believe it to be actually better than the phenomenal reviews this beer possesses.",4.78
Scaled Up,"I was told this is the closest hop profile to Headroom which I have yet to try. If this holds true, Headroom is bound to be incredible. Galaxy+Mosaic is always a winner but the additional hops here add a higher complexity to the flavor which I thoroughly enjoyed.",4.81

Dragonsaddle,"Not to be cliche, but this monster hides the alcohol content extremely well. Super juicy, big pillowy body, and doesn’t carry the sharpness you get from a lot of triples. Finishes clean. Outstanding.",4.88
Dragonsaddle,"Poured into a Hoof Teku. Smell is strong with lots of citrus coming through. Graperfruit, papaya, some orange. Taste follows suit. Absolutely excellent triple IPA. Unbelievably smooth, does not feel like 11.5% at all.",4.59
Dragonsaddle,"This is the upper echelon of of triple IPA’s. The aroma is full of citrus fruit and tropical notes, coming at my nose with waves of dank hops, lots of grapefruit, tangerine and sweet grassy notes. Flavor is super juicy and full of citrus with tangerine, mango, guava, pineapple, grapefruit, orange peel, faint lemon zest, some lactose sugar or a creamy essence, then it brings sweet malt, grains, floral notes and graham cracker. It hides the ABV masterfully and is a terrific representation of this style.",4.56
Dragonsaddle,"Poured into a snifter. Very hazy bright yellow color with a modest white head. Big tropical, grassy, and earthy aroma. Taste followed: pineapple, berries, mango, grass, and dank flavors. Smooth, full-bodied, and soft bitterness. One of my favorite TIPAs.",4.41
Dragonsaddle,"Amazing Triple IPA! Definitely one of the best I've ever drank! I was able to try this from a pretty old can, and even still it was hazy and super delicious. Very lucky to drink an all-time great!!",4.78
Dragonsaddle,Another awesome IPA from Hoof. ,5
Dragonsaddle,"Drinking from a 16oz can into glass. I have a hunch that perhaps this can has been sitting around for a while as the aroma and taste is very muted and borderline stale (dare I say). Even still its a tasty big beer, with a surprisingly thin body for 11.5%. Not top shelf worthy, at least not the can I drank from.",4.2
Dragonsaddle,"To me, this is about as close to a perfect beer. The best part is how hidden the alcohol is. Sure you can't crush a bunch of these but just one could be just enough. With it's limits, that makes perfect sense to me.",4.98
Dragonsaddle,"Tasted from can. Pours a cloudy yellow with nice fluffy white head. Aroma is big time tropical fruits. Lots of pineapple, mango, papaya and a hint of pine. Moderately bitter. Hides ABV extremely well. Huge tropical fruit flavor taste similar to aroma with some dank notes. Top notch imperial ipa.",4.94
Dragonsaddle,"Hazy as all get out, and mango fruit punch for days - I've had a lot from Hoof Hearted, but this is by far their masterpiece. Good luck believing it's a Triple IPA too, because it drinks like a single! One of my new favorites.",4.79
Dragonsaddle,The beer comes in a hazy medium gold color.,4.74
Dragonsaddle,"Pours a hazy golden color with pure white head. Aroma is lots of tropical fruit. Flavor follows the nose with big notes of papaya, mango and citrus. Has a bit of bitterness on the back end with a clean citrus peel aftertaste. Has a nice drinkable body and overall very delicious.",4.58
Dragonsaddle,From can. Pours a milky orange. Very impressive head for a trip/abv. Sticky lacing stays in place well. Minimal booze in the nose. Honeydew and grapefruit rind? Great smell anyhow. Very sweet to mask abv. Noticeable carb but an overall smooth finish. Nice and sticky. Solid beer.,4.46
Dragonsaddle,"Poured from the can into a tulip. Huge beer, but pretty easy drinking considering the ABV. Tropical fruit, minimal bitterness, solid mouthfeel. Really solid triple IPA!",4.29
Dragonsaddle,L: standard TIPA color nothing special looking but very good looking,4.99
Dragonsaddle,Surprisingly one of the better triple ipas out there. Not overly bitter and weedy/dank. ,4.38
Dragonsaddle,"For me, I have experienced all of the hoof hearted beers I have wanted to sample. This.... this is the best by far. It is absolutely delicious with every sip you take. It has only gotten better with age. I can't really describe it too much. The aroma is pineapple, mango, peach, orange. The taste is straight juice with some hop bitterness. And the alcohol is covered so well that I can't even seem to distinguish where it begins and ends. It is one of the best examples of what this brewery can do and one of the best beers I have had all year. I truly love this beer and the 16.99 I paid for the four pack (x3 because I bought 3 total 4 packs) is well worth it. I think they have finally found there stride at hoof. I had roller blabe and didn't enjoy it till I waited 5 weeks post batch. South of Eleven was excellent. I really liked Konkey Dong. And this beer... this beer is truly why I drink the style. I just absolutely love it! I hope they can brew it more then once a year, but if that is the case... I will be back next year! Great job Hoof. You have finally made me want to consistently go to every release!",4.75

Dragonsaddle,L: Pours a dark gold with a nice head that stays around a bit.,4.79
Dragonsaddle,"First beer I've given a 5 across the board..best IPA I've had to date, this is a deceptive beer it drinks like a TH double IPA but is so slam packed with fruity hops and more hazy..oh yeah and it's 11.5%, I've never tried a beer that hides it's booze content this well, a hazy delight.",5
Dragonsaddle,"L - not so sure about this label. Muscular humanoid topless dragon with a classic male stripper bow tie... and that's it. But then he's got a guitar in one hand and a wizard RPG character riding him. I have no idea. Pours a neon radioactive grassy orange green right out of the can. Damn! Murky, swampy... the color of dragon scales?",4.74
Dragonsaddle,This is an absolute dream to drink. 11.5% ABV that is completely hidden. Huge burst of tropical fruit with the perfect amount of pine. Seak out if you can. World class IIIPA,4.83
Dragonsaddle,"Tried it from the can and also poured into a snifter for review purposes. Really really cloudy beer, dirty yellow with almost a brownish tint. Very healthy lacing, but I can't tell how active the carbonation is because it is so cloudy. A gigantic juicy hop bomb on the nose. I could just keep smelling this thing if it didn't taste so damn good as well. Big juicy hop characteristics for the taste. It doesn't present much in the way of bitterness, maybe just a little at the end, but it's very citrusy with a slight sharp zesty tanginess that hits the center of the tongue. For a beer that is almost 12%, the alcohol is hidden rather well. This is a really outstanding beer.",4.69
Dragonsaddle,"L: Hazy, dark OJ hues with an ample white fluffy head",4.71
Madagascar,"Picked this up in Jenks, OK; thrilled to find it...",4.41
Madagascar,A barrel-aged milk stout is piqued my interest. The beer is 50 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The beer produced a one-finger dark brown head. The beer's head was airy and creamy. The retention on the head was feeble. The color of the beer is SRM 36 a deep brown nearly black. The clarity of the beer is opaque. The head dissipated to a ring around the glass. ,4.47
Madagascar,"
A bit too boozy for me to truly love, but a fine vanilla-forward treat.",4
Madagascar,"
If you like vanilla beans you should go out and find this beer ASAP. This beer captures a massive amount of vanilla bean flavor while still showcasing great roast grains and a bourbon barrel underneath. A wonderful compliment to the battle for Winterfell.",4.49
Madagascar,"L -- 1,000 lumens passed through the glass reveals a very dark brown body with total clarity. Scant half finger of mocha colored head produced with moderate pour. Minimal retention or lacing",4.36
Madagascar,Tasted from a KBBS teku on 4-7-19. The booze in the aroma was stronger than the booze in the taste. The vanilla flavor was nicely prevalent. Medium carbonation. I think with a bit more bourbon heat this would be even better.,4.15
Madagascar,Let this guy warm up. ,4.19
Madagascar,"man oh man have i been wanting to try this one. finally grabbed a bomber of the most recent batch, poured into a tulip a dark, dark liquid with a brown little ring of a head that is now just a slim bit of bubbles on the edge. the first sniff of this i know there's something special. bourbon, vanilla, chocolate and toffee all blend together beautifully. just the right amount of sweetness, absolute heaven. flavor is more subdued, with vanilla powering in over a chocolate milk base, with a swig of bourbon making its way in from time to time. sweet but never overwhelming, making it smooth enough to drink as fast as you want. its full bodied but thin at the same time, drinks not too much different from the rest of their stouts. but the overall experience here is something to be cherished. happy i've enjoyed this one finally",4.5
Madagascar,"Finally got to try this. Good amount of vanilla in this, with hints of chocolate. My old complaint with it is that the body is a bit weird. I think maybe because it's a milk stout instead of a RIS? Also, there's quite a bit more carbonation than I normally like. ",4.1
Madagascar,"Absolutely beautiful right from the pour. A solid finger of dark brown foam sits atop an inviting, ebony black brew. Head retention is very good for the style.",4.59
Madagascar,I should start by admitting that I am a vanilla junkie. There is a perfect amount of vanilla flavor In this and it perfectly balances the bourbon barrel flavor from dominating. Great job!,5
Madagascar,"This beer was a let down. I went to the brewery in Missouri and was so excited for the ""copius"" amounts of Vanilla. The flavor did not come through. This beer should not be on the top 500 let alone 200",3.75
Madagascar,Pours a very dark chestnut brown with two-and-a-half fingers of mocha-colored head. Sheets of lacing.,4.07
Madagascar,Vintage 2018,4.15
Madagascar,"Opaque, near black body, with a frothy, cola-like beige head that dissipates with a hiss. Vanilla scents leap out, followed by lovely milk chocolate notes. Lactose and vanilla extract are prominent. Sweet, with a thinner than expected body. A delicious dessert kind of beer.",4.21
Madagascar,"Drank from a 1 pint, 6 fl oz bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA",4.61
Madagascar,"Pours black with an eggshell thin layer of khaki fizz. Aroma is strong vanilla, with bourbon, char, and roasted and toasted malts. It smells like a vanilla Coca-Cola. Flavor profile is vanilla bean, milk chocolate, bourbon, char, and roasted and toasted malts. Bourbon is certainly present, but is balanced well enough to keep from being boozy. Really, the bourbon just adds a little extra character and depth in an otherwise thin flavor profile. All total, it tastes like Vanilla Coca-Cola, with emphasis on the vanilla. Mouth feel is thin, fizzy and harsh - it drinks like a soda pop, albeit a little smoother. Fortunate note here is that it thickens up just a bit as the beer warms, but it is still barely scraping ""medium-thin"". Overall, it's thin and harsh, which isn't good for any beer especially a stout. Vanilla notes are strong and refrain from coming across as artificial, which is a plus, but beyond that isn't much. ",4
Madagascar,"Wow. This is what I've always wanted in a vanilla stout. Aroma has tons of vanilla, some bourbon, roasted malt, caramel, chocolate. Smells like vanilla extract. Very nice. Taste follows with lots of vanilla, roasted malts, brown sugar, a little chocolate and just the right amount of barrel presence. Impressive how much they nailed the vanilla in this one.",4.43
Madagascar,"650ml bottle, undated but assumed to be fresh from the 2018 release, poured into a 12oz wine glass.",4.08
Madagascar,"Bottle poured; very little head and carbonation. Subtle hint of bourbon, no hint of vanilla. First sip - vanilla and chocolate pronounced on front followed by coffee and bourbon on back. As it warms, the vanilla notes begin to release. Silky smooth on palate.",4.49
Madagascar,First review of Madagascar: 2017 vintage.,4.39
Madagascar,"Yeah, this works for me! Lots of vanilla on the nose and taste. Just the right amount of barrel and sweetness. Feel is medium and slick. Overall a delicious stout that i would glady drink anytime.",4.5

Flora - Blueberry,"pours out a beautiful glowing ruby color with a very fizzy pink tinged-white head. inviting aromas of berry melange, tart blueberry, green apple, earthy hay, mellow barnyard funk - smells like a country beer! the flavors follow beautifully with under-ripe blueberries, grape skin, tart apple, hay, oak, mild earthy funk, almost a musty grape quality, sweet tarts, mellow vegetal quality, supremely crisp and effervescent. ridiculously refreshing and delicious!",4.71
Flora - Blueberry,A - Pours a dark purple with a quick dissipating head,4.85
Flora - Blueberry,"Pours a beautiful violet color with a thin short-lived head. The nose is full of a cheesy sweaty funk, hints of sweet blueberry, vinouse wine, woody dryness, and earth. I get more blueberry on the mouth than the nose, reminiscent of juicy fruity blueberry jam mixed with wine. The finish is earthy and mildly funky. Medium body, clean and fairly juicy mouthfeel with soft and faint carbonation. Not the best blueberry beer available but I definitely enjoyed this.",3.97
Flora - Blueberry,"First review in months. Been slacking, but I figured Blueberry Flora was a good time to start up again.",4.74
Flora - Blueberry,Purchased at Hill Farmstead in 6/2014,4.23
Flora - Blueberry,"I've never had ann or mimosa, but this might be Mr. Hill's best beer. I don't want to like it as much as I do. I can also see this aging quite well. Brought comparisons to LP Kriek (which we had about 45 minutes prior). Hate on the man who brewed it all you want, this beer is the real deal.",4.75
Flora - Blueberry,"Appearance: pours a deep purple. almost black. a small, centimeter or two, pinkish head, with weak retention but some lacing. hazy and with some sediment.",4.24
Flora - Blueberry,"Pour is a transparent blood purple with a pink head. Nose is a really nice blueberry cake aroma, nice faint grain and a decent yeast, faint vanilla and some fair oak, leathery brett towards the back. Taste is very nice, lots of bright blueberries, a bit of yeast, notes of oak, brett is just a hint strong in the back thinning out the great flavors a small amount with a bitter finish. Body is bigger, a bit prickly in the back, strong carb.",4

Overall: This is a great blueberry beer - the blueberry flavor matches the fruit not the artificial blueberry stuff. Nice and mild, with the right amount of funk and sour.",4.54
Flora - Blueberry,"A lovely, dark blueberry colour with hints of ruby shining through.",4.85

Flora - Blueberry,"Poured into a wine glass, a gorgeous dark pink. Fairly see through. Very little head that dissipated rapidly. Hugely drinkable. Really just want to chug this. Supremely subtle, nice wine flavor. Picking up the blueberries only slightly in their sweetness and tartness. Lots of carbonation. This is going down way too easy. Really good.",4.35

Sure Bet,"Smells great, tastes awful. Way, way, way too sweet. Also a bit effervescent which is unpleasant on the mouthfeel. Could only bring a few beers back from Chicago, unfortunately I gave this one suitcase space",2.53
Sure Bet,"A very nice take on the west coast style by Pipeworks! One finger head on a dark auburn filtered brew. Smells mostly of bubblegum (chicklets), papaya and a little mango. Tastes even more on the Bubble gum side but is very enjoyable and not hot, though my friend and I did get some indigestion soon afterwards.",4.4
Sure Bet,"One of Pipework's better malt-forward IPAs featuring the unicorn on the label art. This one still has a great hop character to it, accented by honey. Not too much evidence of the mango puree, just a general tropical fruitiness that I could believe was a product of the hops on their own.",4.3
Sure Bet,It pours a clear amber with a small white head,4.25
Sure Bet,Hazy dark golden color with off-white head. Aroma is quite malty with overripe oranges and orange rind. Taste is also citrus forward with overripe oranges and tangerines and a slightly nutty malt backbone. Medium body and carbonation. Quite bitter aftertaste. Not bad but quite disappointing. Maybe I got an old bottle.,3.75
Sure Bet,"L: amber gold with a light haze under a 1.5"" white blanket of foam",4.25
Sure Bet,"A: The beer is quite hazy yellow in color—too hazy to see if there is any visible carbonation. It poured with a quarter finger high white head that quickly settled down, leaving a narrow collar around the edge of the glass and some lacing down the sides.",4.19
Sure Bet,"Between MN distribution & a good trading partner, I’m rapidly becoming a huge Pipeworks fan. This is the latest 22 oz. bomber to show up in the Land of 10,000 Lakes. Split with my wife. ",3.57
Sure Bet,Pours a slight hazed golden color with a white head. Smell had citrus and mango. Taste was fruity with alot of mango the honey muted the mango puree is a good way very tasty. Slight bitter mouth feel with a pine like feel had and orange and mango finish.,4.19
Sure Bet,"White head. Lace. Golden orange color. Clear, not hazy. ",4.25
Sure Bet,"Pours an almost clear only slightly hazy amber/orange with a huge pillow of white head that sticks around and leaves fabulous lacing. Aroma is sweet ripe tropical fruits. Flavor is honey and fruit, no bitterness to speak of. Feel is thick for the style with a medium amount of carbonation. Overall a nice beer that (IMO) needs a little more bitterness in the finish to offset the sweetness of this beer.",4.27
Sure Bet,"Features honey and mango puree, and Citra and Mosaic hops...",4.29
Sure Bet,"It's funny to me that this is one of Pipeworks' highest rated beers, while their stouts haven't made top 250 - funny how the world spins.",4.25

Not much aroma going on to be honest. Flavor is disappointing. No honey or mango at all. Pretty standard imperial Ipa. Feel is sticky and medium bodied. Overall, this is disappointing. Literally got none of the flavors advertised.",3.49

Sure Bet,"Hazy faded gold with a fluffy white head. Smell features lush mango, honey, candied orange, pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit, pine, and lime. Taste is much the same, but simpler, more focused on sweet mango and honey contrasting with the pine, hops, and slight flowers. Feel is resinous, hoppy and slightly thick. Great flavoring, but definitely on the heavier and heavy handed side of the spectrum.",4.38
Sure Bet,Straw color with white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is hoppy with a fruit accent. Taste is also hoppy with a fruit accent. This was not as flavorful as expected,4.31
