Ground State,batch 3 2018 poured into an alesmith snifter pours a medium dark espresso nose is mostly maple coffee and oak with some butterscotch and caramel palate is chocolate fudge maple coffee with oak and butterscotch notes disappointingly the chocolate and maple dominates the barrel character so it’s not as complex as one might hope still a good brew but its not in the upper tier of the category,0.6944780790867822

Focal Banger,a very solid finetasting nestyle ipa but just couldnt hold its own against the morelauded heady topper i would have loved to know how fresh this beer was since it was so hard to get  but i just couldnt find the canning date anywhere pours a very nice slightly hazy yellow color with abundant fluffy white head and sheets of lingering lacing looks very very nice smells of lots of fresh tropical fruity hops  grapefruit mango lemon pineapple tangerine  as well as some weaker floral hops malt vanilla and bread some weaker dank notes at the end taste follows the nose but there was a decent hit of hoppy bitterness towards the middle and finish that wasnt unpleasant just a little more sharp than i was accustomed to i also expected more juiciness and i just didnt get it  maybe that left more harshness of the hops good solid mellow mild mouthfeel and good carbonation not really sticky i was just expecting a softer mouthfeel akin to heady topper tree house green and some other worldclass nestyle ipas a great effort but ill keep looking for heady,0.6810997918710446

Beer:Barrel:Time,it poured a super thick and viscous in the glass pitch black color with very little head very little carbonation the smell is sweet with tons of fudge interlace with bourbon and oak not complex by any means but so balance sweet and rich the flavor profile is just the same  so much rich chocolate fudge in the mouth balanced out with the warming touch of bourbon its sweet with a lot of depth that includes dark chocolate vanilla oak and bourbon all the things you would dream of in a barrel aged stout the mouthfeel is thick and rich without much warmth for a 15 abv beer overall this is a superb beer well remarkable for its balance of flavors its depth of flavors and the thickness some may say its overrated because its not too different from other easy to obtain stouts i have to disagree it is well perfected with its sweetness balance and the bourbon,0.6791206292857861

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,pours a thick oily pitch black coloration with a small creamy head the beer downright sticks to the glass as you swirl it leaving a shortlived film of dark beer and white lace smell is somewwhat subdued pretty underwheming compared to the taste cinnamon is most noticeable with a sort of odd earthy musty woody aroma being pretty dominant as well perhaps a hint of coconut there taste is quite complex lots of chocolate and rum noticeable at first with a decent bit of cinnamon and vanilla coming through as well the chili really grows as you drink and the beer warms quite noticeable in the aftertaste in a really pleasant way quite a bit of warm boozyness there as well but very smooth and mellow at the same time mouthfeel really is fantastic very thick sticky almost oily and very smooth i was considering waiting for cbs for my 100th review but i think this one will do nicely the barrelaging really did wonders to the quite overrated hunapuh here adding a certain complexity from the brandy and rum notes along with making the chili stand out more and generally mellowing out the beer creating a richer harmony still smells really weird though,0.6785271774992633

Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,pours a mangoorange with a murky transparency and a finger of white foam that retains well aroma is earthy papaya tangerine and grapefruit with a little stone and yeast beyond its tropical fruit opening lingers for a while letting the base pale ale which is already very hoppy show throw in fragments aroma is akin to a very powerful ne ipa flavor profile is papaya tangerine mango tangerine with a little earthy nutty malt and raw grain and yeast to sooth things out its tropical fruit through and through and drinks very similar  identical  to trilliums northeast ipa this is labeled as an american pale ale at the time of review all this to say its incredible hop forward much more so than other pale ales which may be a deterrent for some mouth feel is a little gritty silty and soft with a mediumthick consistency its liken to a wellworn lumpy linen pillow overall despite a slightly misleading style the name of the beer lets those knowledgeable about beer that the hop content is going to be high thus i will not knock it for the style misinterpretation its big and flavorful which is welcome in a beer it combines well with the lightly gritty texture to develop a refined but wellworn and knowledgeable experience,0.6762524149608081

Upper Case,outstanding beer and very different actually a very similar experience to big bird which i lucked into two years ago as i picked up a flat of trillium beers in fort point on our way to cape cod for a biannual multifamily trip i think this one is actually more polished and tasty fresh than big bird was but the amazing hop experience is similar looks like a muddy pineapple juice but the aromas and to a just slightly lesser degree flavors cover just about every hoprelated note i love about hoppy beers citrus pith berries mango musky wine grapes dank hemp tropical fruit wheat biscuit sugared grapefruit absolutely phenomenal grassy but not overly so which is a nice departure from most ne ipas really nice level of sweetness as well and zero green astringency even fresh which distances this beer from big bird feel is a little thin but that doesn’t take anything away from the amazing complex and harmonious nose and tongue amazing that you can throw an ungodly amount of different hops together and get such a wonderful end result,0.6745777246032574

Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,is rodenbach the worlds best brewery belgian style at least this is simply sensational i drank this out of my handy garre glass from a 750 ml bottle i kept outside in the low 50s the beautiful red color bubbles to a quickly vanishing light fizz emitting an earthy fruity aroma my 4yr old child described as rotten fruit candy the taste is fresh fruit but kinda faygo rockin rye followed by oakiness and that delicious flanders red base an earthy tart dry finish this is showing off just how sophisticated beer can be sublime complex wow,0.6727835560126705

Blåbær Lambik,bottle i believe it to be 2015 poured a ruddy muddy purple almost wine like a purplepink frothiness that sits atop the beer aroma promises a very sour aspect to the beer earth vinegar wood and of course a mixture of ripe perfumey blueberries and underripe tart blueberries the flavor was probably not as complex as other cantillon beers i have had but it was surely impressive and flooring it starts off very tart a bright pop of sourness that has a balsamic quality folds into a display of woody blueberry wine i loved how dry it finished each sip was better than the last as my palate adjusted to the potency of flavor the body was light and the tartness lingered probably wont have this again so it was definitely a treat,0.6706865376077028
KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout),this beer definitely lives up to its description by the brewery bourbon is present the flavor tastes rounded and finished it pours almost ink black and the tan head manages to stick around for a few minutes smell is complex  again with a bit of bourbon on the nose it feels creamy in the mouth  almost like a milkshake with light carbonation high abv  but it doesnt taste boozy definitely an elite stout,0.6703871708765249
Hopslam Ale,looks like an amber ale really just a touch of light haze fluffy offwhite head fades down to a thin film moderately quickly  some pretty decent lacing during drinking aroma of sweet caramel malt  piney hops not much of anything in the fruit department taste follows with a smack of piney hop  full malt backbone sip ends with a long lingering boozy taste  feel  pleasant but definitely also letting you know its packing a 102 abv i dont taste the honey per se but there is a hint of sweetness  maybe a tinge of strawberry  which is barely tasted but seems to dampen the potential astringency of the hops not sure what i expected from this  certainly a classic ive never tried before from a time before fruity neipas  the better of which ive really come to prefer i would definitely have this again its a great beer but im also fine crossing it off my list  not worrying about seeking it out again,0.6701360141780276
Notorious Triple IPA,coppenhagen beer fest boston sample pour this has been a want of mine for a while it was really good huge and citrusy pithy and resiny but also had some pretty intense fruity hop notes i often find triple ipas are too sweet and boozy the structure of the beer is all off this one bucks that trend,0.6695364059500101
Duck Duck Gooze,042016  this is delicious its got a nose that reminds me a traditional gueuze which rocks for a usbased brewery plus it has fruity vinous notes abound,0.6682767668985905
Samuel Adams Utopias,so different from almost any other beer so intense and so complex pitch black and no head whatsoever molasses raisin and brandy dominate the nose and palate with slight background tones of hazelnut and spice mouthfeel is full and the finish gives a little heat and kick the best part about it is that the taste lingers on your tongue and air passages for a couple minutes after each sip  reminiscent of a good 25 year scotch one of a kind must try,0.6680731124310714
Aaron,pours thick to a teku nearlyopaque dark brown with ruby highlights half a finger of head with a persistent thick dusting that lingers around the rim and is revitalized by swirling redolent on the nose vanilla and brown sugar with bourbon spice on top plum tobacco and raisin join the fray on the palate delicate richly textured and complex with a lot of barrel character lurking tremendous on every dimension,0.667906762555448
Juicy,an extremely impressive little bottle of saison here wonderfully hoppy and wild and quite literally juicy in its overall complexion pale and bright on the pour fizzy at first but settling back quickly less hazy than anticipated but not all the way clear lots of little bubbles rising up the aroma forces an almost smelling salts sort of response from me with an involuntary jerk back of the head whew this is pungent right away i get strong wine tannins a mature bretty funk the gives to a lambic sort of oaky sourness and of course the unmistakable new zealand hops which seem dry hoppy right away my mouth waters like i cant remember so i set right in on the first swig a big whoosh of carbonation takes the beer right to the roof of the mouth and back of the tongue the whole palate is getting in on this right from the get go amazing wild yeast complexion thats what i love most about this one super funky farmy brett with soft green apple meyer lemon and even white grape notes dry but sort of richer or more complete of a brett spectrum than most but this sort of moves into a more bacterial citric pucker also mature and fully wild like real lambic it certainly has that almost medicinal start and the inoculated woody later bit its certainly at least that complex the hops are fruity too pineapple comes to mind more white wine the wood is soft the mouthfeel is aided by that and its flavor is as woody as it is winey with a nice herbal botanical input from the hops at its peak tangy and sour but not so much so that we didnt wish this came in a three liter bottle my whole palate wanted the whole bottle but i felt compelled to share it highly carbonated and fuller bodied but delicate in its overall presentation dry but not all the way one of the better and more nuanced but also aggressively flavored hill farmstead beers i have had truly distinct and memorable i can still taste it even this is about as much as you can do with brett saison especially for not having fruit in it an enormously delicious beer huge thanks to my trading buddy back east,0.667514824413999
Bodhi,this is a great beer similar to thier standard ipa but more hoppy and much stronger can only have a couple and you must go down in abv color is deeper yellow smell is very skunky flavor is fantastic 12oz bottle columbus oh 16oz draft at pastimes pub new albany oh,0.6666754437419967
Triple Sunshine,poured straight from the can the beer pours a peachy orange color with pretty decent head retention and light lacing on the nose i get considerable orange citrus tropical fruit and pine although the beer is also noticeably boozy which tends to give the orange citrus aroma more of an orange syrup component on the palate this is just a hot mess while theres some decent orange citrus and tropical fruit the sweet malt comes on strong in the midpalate which tends to accentuate the high alcohol in this beer the beer is so hot and alcoholic on the finish that it completely overwhelms and drowns the considerable hoppy bitterness the sweetness carries through on the finish which unfortunately just makes an already boozy ipa taste even more alcoholic the burn on the finish is unpleasant and makes drinking this beer an absolute chore one i was unable fulfill as i ended up dumping this half way through the glass,0.6658397642825
Lou Pepe - Framboise,a 2010 vintage generously shared with me after quite literally years of anticipating this bottle together its incredible stuff worth the wait and as good as anything i have had from these guys really every bit as good as the lou kriek or the fou deep dusty brick red in color dense with fruit here not as electric and bright looking as a lot of raspberry beers and with a fizzy lazy head not super robust there the nose is mind melting for me pure raspberry and insanely mature lambic funk and tartness turbid wheaty aged hop base tons of oak and brett a well developed wild acidity as well this is rather piquant and then of course all the berry as natural as it gets and like stuffing an entire handful of them in my face as intense as can be i smell it for awhile before i taste it so complex and mouthwatering and inviting great sourness up front in the flavor highlights the fruit right from the start with the sturdy wood and mature wildness right there with it tart and red winey towards the finish a little sweet from the fruit still malty in a lambic sense and really brightly acidic and interesting the complexity of the yeast elements here is as good as it gets and why cantillon is so well regarded as far as i am concerned the raspberries are perfect with it and really bold in this beer the maturity is unrivaled and the flavor is just incredible beautiful lambic famous for a reason and probably even more striking to me now in terms of quality because there are so many lackluster fruited sours out there in the world this is the cream,0.6657249997768149
Darkstar November,my favorite beer so complex and nicely balanced the molasses just gives such a nice texture to this beer that you just dont see in others not too sweet not too bitter perfection,0.6657175912840902

Haze,dont bogart that haze or so the can says i purchased the can directly from the brewery it has a canned date of 722019 5 days prior to the date of purchase the beer has a beautiful haze and is a thick orange yellow color i get a slight fruity smell on the nose very pleasant but faint i smell peaches and a little citrusy scent the taste is peachy with no noticeable bitter flavors and a good amount of carbonation the alcohol content is also well hidden in the flavor the beer has a thick mouthfeel and is very smooth haze is a good representative of a new england double ipa,0.6652805136704475
Duck Duck Gooze,pours darker than i expected the color is similar to apple juice with a ring of bubbles on the edge of the glass aroma is bursting with fruit  apple pear apricot peach and white wine oak and soft funk also comes through strong flavors on the taste everything comes through so balanced and well integrated i get tons of vanilla as well there is a soft funk in the background  wet hay barnyard some band aid its there but the fruit is still center stage the flavors are bright and vibrant but they dont fall off quickly either complex intense this is the best beer ive had to date,0.6650756440510854

Double Sunshine,080819 canning date purchased at lawson’s beautiful newish tasting room which is well worth a visit for its woodbedecked beer hall very friendly staff excellent local food sunny terrace with cornhole and of course excellent beer visited on 81819 double sunshine is simply the most pleasantly pungent smelling hoppy and juicy yet not too sweet tasting vermont double ipa while lawson’s sip of sunshine is now more widely available and has a similar if more muted taste profile this one spelunks the nasal passages and does a hopladen tango on the tongue in a sidebyside comparison with heady topper this is the more beautifully complex albeit slightly less sweet to the taste winner,0.6645652337812098
Hommage,lived up to my high expectations a bright pink color in the glass with a modest white head aromas and taste lined up with bright raspberry and cherry bathed in complex funk there was a mineral quality to the beer that complimented the flavors,0.6643396051013513

Coolship Red,been hunting this one for years as captain ahab quipped this is what ye have shipped for men to chase that white whale on both sides of the land over all sides of the earth beautiful ruby red pour that glowed in the sunlight with no head after initial surface carbonation smell was the star deep raspberry both fresh skins and sour insides beautiful oak full of character wheat vanilla wild flower wild belgian yeast apricot and red wine barrel influences taste is way more subtle but not really any less complex or beautiful just wanted a little more bite like the belgian lambics do on the finish simultaneously vinous sweet tart boozy and funky well worth the hunt but does not compete with the belgian lambics of fame,0.6630835647435152

V.S.O.J.,2018 vintage tasted in a snifter from draft at otooles on february 5 2019 a celebration of malt oak and patience very special old straight jacket is a cuvée of english barleywines each aged between two and three years in bourbon barrels lusciously sweet and colossally complex vsoj is equal parts refinement and excess,0.6597351210896529
Double Shot,pours a dark brown with tan head it smells of intense coffee no bitterness at all to this just fudgey chocolate and coffee smooth as hell its very approachable in the way that every tree house is approachable this no doubt tastes great and is super smooth but it is also the type of coffee stout that people who dont drink coffee stouts would like its not super complex and has one note of those three flavors,0.6595276207997992
Vicinity,delicious smooth with tons of flavor fruity hazy with a great finish definitely not overdone with the alcohol content like some double ipas have to be honest surprised it’s a double ipa almost to smooth to be a double,0.659284265386171
Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,bourbon barrel aged imperial stout with coffee which on paper sounds like the same thing a million other breweries are doing but in reality is unique as can be more concentrated and intense in all aspects than almost anything else in this field i have had before which is a large sample size for sure the coffee here is so fresh earthy and rich its roasted like crazy with an obvious dark chocolate profile that blends in beautifully with all the dark malts which in this case stand out more than in a lot of these due to the apparent lack of a sweet malty middle its all dry and roasty near black with the only sweetness at all in here coming from the bourbon which has honey and vanilla and toasted marshmallow aspects to its sweetness but its not from grain it almost tastes like an ice beer like some of the water was frozen out to make the beer thicker and more pronounced in the flavors the dark malt here is really deep and the coffee is dosed heavily enough to match it all the way through there is a lot of charred oak on this a faint hint of coconut and raisin right up front and lots more chocolate the whiskey is pretty strong here too but it brings the coffee together with the wood and the heft of the grain rich vanilla and maple notes in it and just a little warming alcohol this is amazingly complex and delicious a hell of a breakfast beer and another reason why i am increasingly obsessed with this brewery this is one of the best of its kind,0.6589554092564566
Birth Of Tragedy,nice complex taste with this beer really well done and i think underrated not too sweet at all and the coffee notes are perfect great smell and the body is amazing,0.6588925748273837
Abricot Du Fermier,poured from a 750ml bottle into an oversized snifter pours a hazy and bubbly orange with fluffy bright white head which eventually dissipates leaving a nice foam collar around the glass some offwhite swirls remain throughout the pour smells of fresh sliced apricot oak wine and a hint of vanilla it’s all there and combines for an amazing aroma but the fruit is the star here the barrels give it more complexity than it would have otherwise but it’s very fruit forward taste is basically dominated by fruit however the barrel characteristics are more noticeable than on the nose it’s sour but it’s also refreshing borders on light and heavy as it starts off lighter simple and more refreshing but gets heavier and more complex as it lingers on the tongue and finishes feel is smooth and full with an oaky dryness on the finish overall this is my favorite fruited fermier as i feel like apricot works so well with sour beer the combination of the base beer along with red wine barrels and apricots is exquisite this one probably doesn’t show the balance that some of the other fruited fermiers have pêche and kriek come to mind but i don’t mind that at all as this allows the apricots to shine with just enough backup from the extendedaged base sdf,0.6585674833151373
La Fosse,i am surprised to learn this is the same base beer as fuzzy which to me wasnt anywhere near this sour this beer seems way more acidic to me but maybe thats the impact of the different fruits on it or of its relative maturity i really dont know either way this is up there with the very best beers i have had from side project to date pale hazy lambic looking beer with a fizzy white head that dissipates fast the aroma is the best part for me woody bretty funk with citrusy bacterial tang over a pale wheaty base it is lambic at its core it seems but the fruit is so vibrant here soft super ripe apricots their absolute essence intense and amazingly enticing sometimes apricots and peaches can be a little samey in beers depending on how they are used but there is no mistaking these apricots so true to the real fruit in its best form the flavor is like that too with a lot of the sourness and wild yeast flavor and wood on the front end and all the fruit showing up later on i like the progression of flavors moving this way the fruit lingers long in the finish but the beer is very dry its a step more sour than it needs to be i think it sort of hurts the teeth like that has an overdeveloped bacterial sting and sits litle vinegary in the belly still nice bretty notes about as fruity as the apricots themselves great carbonation and a very light body a very special beer and perhaps as good an apricot wild beer as has been made in the states,0.6582147100162274
Saison Bernice,had this one tap at the source in capitola and was blown away super complex sour notes but also a nice sweet finish the carb is perfect and very refreshing,0.6580904745066399
Abricot Du Fermier,this is the best sour saison i have ever had not even up for debate the apricot is the perfect star for all of the delicately balanced flavors in the original has a bit of wine dryness to go with the sour and smooth tartness that really made the mouthfeel just mindbendingly good rich complex smooth and acidic,0.6569571480678671
Pliny The Younger,finally found it orange gold with a fair bit of haze which surprised me elder certainly has no haze big aroma of fruit fantastic fruit flavor doesnt come over in the taste as much as i was expecting more floral and piney huge hoppy finish ridiculously smooth for a triple ipa most triple ipas i have had seem to throw hops in to throw hops in this seems to have been carefully crafted for sure all in all a huge fantastic beer and worth the hype in my opinion,0.6569126781028626
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,for some reason it has taken me a while to warm to ten fidy though i am well aware of its high reputation well this ba version has really brought me around  it’s a very fine beer indeed black as night right to the edges wonderful rich boozy nose redolent with nutty dark honey malts a tangle of complex whiskey notes and almost stinging vanilla extract the taste really fires on all cylinders with the subtle elegant power of a maserati the super charged whiskey is amazingly well balanced by a super strong malt backbone that ranges from honey through black molasses to traces of charcoal dry bitter chocolate and just a hint of dried cherries i had to move my rating for the feel up a notch  it’s really finely crafted i can no longer deny it this is a world class beer,0.6566831186669574
