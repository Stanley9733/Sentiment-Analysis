If we were to recommend these to our customer they would be dissatisfied, proving the need for similarity and sentiment analysis. This also shows that ratings for beers may not be completely relevant for each user. In this example, we took 25 reviews from each beer but in reality we  have to take caution that we don't weigh one rating too heavily. For example, if a beer has only one positive review it will rank high on our list but that review may not be reflective of the overall sentiment towards the beer. \n",
